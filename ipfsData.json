In addition, as outlined [here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxlisbon-contributor-stipend-and-funds/3367), I'm also asking for 300 xDai as a reimboursement for the flights to Lisbon to join the ETHLisbon hackathon.\n\n## Proof of work\n\nI’ve mainly focused on Carrot this past month, covering all development tasks. On the side I've also performed some developments on the Swapr frontend, namely:\n\n- Added SWPR on xDai to the SDK and to the Swapr default token list.\n- Prepared the beta 6 and 6.1 releases.\n- Fixed an issue for which not all pairs were shown on the frontend in case many are created (the issue manifested itself on xDai first where pairs with a considerable amount of liquidity were not shown in the \"all pairs\" page).\n- Fixed an issue that caused reward amounts/tokens to be mismatched in a farming campaign page when the farming campaign had 2 or more reward tokens. The issue first manifested itself with the ARBI/SWPR campaign on Arbitrum. An update to the subgraph was necessary and the frontend was subsequently updated to adapt to the subgraph GraphQL API schema change.\n- Renamed APY to APR across the frontend (no compounding due to LP fees currently taken into account in the farmign campaigns returns calculation).\n- Prepared the beta 6.2 release.\n\nThe proof about the claims above can be verified by having a look at [my commits on the Swapr frontend](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/commits/develop?author=luzzif) and [Swapr SDK](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-sdk/commits/develop?author=luzzif).\n\nI've also made an update to the lambda function Coingecko currently uses to fetch various Swapr-related data (most importantly, currently active farming campaigns across chains), adding an endpoint to fetch SWPR's circulating supply. The endpoint is currently used by Coingecko to display that info in the SWPR token page. Have a look at the proof of work by clicking [here](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-coingecko/commits/master?author=luzzif).\n\nOn the farming smart contracts, I've added a standalone campaign smart contract, which can be used to create staking-based reward campaigns even without deploying a factory. Proof [here](https://github.com/luzzif/erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts/commits/master).\n\nMost of the work though, has been performed on Carrot, for which as of now I don't have proof, since the code is still private until the release comes (hopefully soon). Nice progress has been made in the frontend, with a flexible framework to display custom charts for various metric types and massive improvements to the UI and responsiveness. Once the code is made public in the future, proof for these claims will be available to everyone since pretty much all the commits on the platform are mine, so keep an eye out for that.","title":"DAI payout (26/09/2021-26/10/2021) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmaUVViW5EB7xwYyBZNq1Q9VcxfNjTWxogJYFJc8bPQAVy"},"0x00ab138b59eb3ba06c51494920ce00c6d6f296743f6ec5a53bbe1ba0dc18e10e":{"description":"## Timeframe:\n\n31/07/2022-31/09/2022, 2 months\n\nI wanna preface this proposal by apologizing for being late and it was because of Nimi proposal that wasn’t yet resolved and I didn’t have clear idea what to write.\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nSwapr (60%):\n\n* Curve Factory Pools implementation on the SDK\n* Making sure we follow up with the front-end refactoring plan and storybook usage\n* DIY Farming Top up Campaigns\n* Bugs and improvements\n* Eco router Improvements and new Dexes\n\nNimi(40%):\n\n* Making sure we have top notch front-end along with writing bunch of features which we are doing all the time!\n\n* Onboarding of new devs\n\n## Proof of work:\n\n* In the previous period the big focus was refactoring I spent alot of time researching best react design patters and practices. I lead couple of discussions related to it here is the google docs with the summary https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mr9gleqXWNDVrJ27hEKaBC29etMUNVjYRQdyeffEyH8\n* Storybook: implemented storybook and also had a sync call with DxGov squad to make sure its similar structure heres the pr https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pull/1129 and also I setup Chromatic automatic deployment which we are planning to integrate with Figma for smoother development flow\n* Farming section improvements such as [Farming Simulation](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pull/1001) and [DIY farming reward improvements](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pull/1079)\n\n## Self evaluation previous working period:\n\nWhat I didn’t do well:\n\n* Sometimes I get so focused on tasks Im on that Im not that active on the chats and following whats happening. I wish to improve on that.\n* Drama that was happening brought me lot of stress and definitely impacted my productivity. I guess I should learn to not get so riled up by that and just focus on work.\n\nWhat I did well:\n\n* Research related to front-end restructuring really helped me alot on improving my knowledge of react. I think some time dedicated to just learning instead of implementing can go a long way! Also discussion with other developers are really good way to improve. What I really liked were are few discussion with Diogo, Velu and Berteotti related to front-end refactoring where we all prepared beforehand which can set a precedent on how this can be done in the future.\n\n## Compensation\n\nI will be applying as level 5 full-time for two months.

The bonding curve [was later shut down](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x97c7d7e5ed9f74f62ef5d15a6dffac8a62a4d52b883491a7e8b13cf7816991ad), and the[ DXD Buyback Program](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8)<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> </span>was passed in May 2021 to acquire DXD on the open market in a trustless manner. The original proposal authorized $1m in DXD purchases; the program was clarified and expanded to the buyback reserve and has been extended an additional seven times (each extension authorizing $1m in new purchases). \n\nIn the year since the program launched, [13,391.41 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing) have been purchased on mainnet and Gnosis Chain for an[ average price of 0.178 ETH/DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing). Using the USD price at the time of purchase, $7.5m of DXD has been purchased.\n\nIn addition to the DXD minted from the bonding curve, there has also been DXD issuance from DXdao’s original 100k DXD pre-mint. So far, 475 DXD has been issued on-chain to contributors in vested contracts or marketing expenses. An additional 458 DXD was issued to LPs to Swapr LPs for farming last summer, and DXdao has committed to an additional ~2,600 DXD (estimated) to contributors that has not been issued to vesting contracts.\n\nSo in total, starting from the original circulating supply of 48,976 DXD, subtracting the 13,391 DXD purchased through the buyback program and adding the 3,533 that’s been issued from the DXdao pre-mint, **results in a current circulating supply of ~39,118 DXD**, although more than 1,500 DXD is vesting for another 2+ years. The current DXD price on Swapr is $683, so the current market capitalization of DXD is $26.3m, still comfortably below the ~$45m in the [DXdao general treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) and [the buyback reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521).\n\nAfter the initial proposal, DXdao governance [shifted towards a new token model](https://daotalk.org/t/proposed-dxd-token-model/2898), where ETH from the bonding curve buyback reserve would be used to purchase DXD. Since the buyback reserve is actually in the DXD token contract, ETH from the general treasury has been used until the token contract is updated.\n\n\n### **Adjustments and clarifications**\n\nOver the past few months, the community has been trying to reach consensus on issues regarding the Buyback Program, namely 1. The accounting breakdown between DXD in General Treasury vs. DXD buyback reserve 2. Clarification on what counts as NAV 3. Continued support for DXD buyback after the DXD Buyback Reserve is depleted \n\nRegarding these issues, this proposal approves the following:\n\n\n\n1. The DXD purchased through [the first buyback proposal](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) (3,659), which did not mention the buyback reserve, can remain in the general treasury where it could be used for liquidity provisioning or other use cases deemed appropriate by DXdao governance. The rest of the DXD purchased through subsequent buyback extensions (9,732.41), as well as any future DXD that’s purchased using funds from the buyback reserve, should be burned. In terms of ETH spent, 481 ETH was used from the general treasury and 1,897 ETH from the buyback reserve (currently). \n2. The Buyback Program has previously defined DXdao’s NAV (or net asset value) as the US dollar amount of ETH and stablecoins in its treasury. This should be clarified to also include any Swapr deposits, staked ETH or any stablecoin deposits on Ethereum mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Arbitrum One and any other sanctioned DXdao base. \n3. If and when the DXD Buyback Program depletes the buyback reserve, funds from the DXdao treasury can be used to purchase DXD on the open market at up to 70% of NAV, so long as this calculation accounts for runway and future funding for product development.\n\n**The Future of DXD:** DXdao governance commits to devote further resources and a dedicated DXD Token Working Group to address long-term questions about DXD value accrual and other questions around NAV calculation, DXdao supplied-liquidity, integration into Governance 2.0 as well as runway for product development. \n\n\n### **Extension Details**\n\nGiven the additional funds left in the Buyback Reserve, this proposal authorizes an additional $1m in DXD purchases under the same conditions as [the previous extension](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xd2114f86cd669d2a34b529e822024d4b280f7427639f0399106c4ae81997a2d8) so long as the circulating market cap of DXD is less than the NAV calculation of its treasury, as further clarified above.\n\nThis proposal sends 373 ETH to the ETHrelayer contract for the multichain multisig, identified as, `0x3e99bEd13071176fE06b317b33e2dcd1E1c9f2BE` , which will relay the ETH to the Multichain multisig address, previously identified as `0x9467dcFD4519287e3878C018c02f5670465a9003` whose signatories have been verified as REP holders, which will convert it to WETH and bridge it over to be deposited into the[ GPv1 relayer on Gnosis Chain](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions), `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`.\n\n\n### **Risks and considerations**\n\nThe DXD buyback program continues to take place on Gnosis Chain, a sidechain with less security properties than Ethereum. The Buyback Program has been running for almost a year with few problems; the GP Relayer has worked to complete the purchases at the market price. There is a concern that Gnosis Protocol v1 on Gnosis Chain will have limited support, but DXdao community members are striving to maintain the network of solvers. The community is also exploring additional options\n\nDXdao has already spent over $7.5m repurchasing DXD. This has increased the price of DXD relative to ETH but it still falls below the book value of ETH in the treasury.\n\nFull execution of this proposal relies on the Multichain multi-sig, which has already bridged and transferred millions of dollars of assets to Gnosis Chain.\n\nAdditional questions on DXD token value accrual after the buyback reserve is depleted, the relationship between the treasury and DXdao operations and product development, as well as integrations with Governance 2.0 still need to be addressed by DXdao governance in the future.\n","title":"DXD Buyback Program Adjustments, Extension #8 and Transfer of 373 ETH [Mirror Proposal]","hash":"QmfEbQWW3zfzRKCfbxJ3cHezuBLyv37FkFq9StcKfVncyh"},"0x02f9259985b7bb83419ffcb539eb169bb3d802bcfb92a5f4a59c424d47318204":{"description":" I, Cantillon#9803, am requesting REP in relation to my DXdao Discord participation level.

DXdao participated in GGG as a sponsor and conducted multiple talks and workshops throughout the week-long conference. It was a positive experience for so many DXdao contributors to attend the conference. During GGG I co-led a Contributor Experience focused workshop at the DAOist on “Building Healthier Teams.” This workshop allowed me the opportunity to discuss the challenges contributors face within a DAO, as well as highlight the amazing work DXdao is doing in the people operations area of our DAO. A detailed article on the workshop can be found here:The Daoist GGG - “Open Office Hours” — The DAOist\n\n**What was okay:**\n \nIn the past 2 months, I supported the onboarding of 2 new developers, @jorgelopes @velusgautam and QA engineer @Philipp16. I believe I did okay at integrating these new contributors with the current contributors at DXdao. As we grow, my goal is to ensure new contributors are not only onboarding by familiarizing themselves with DXdao operations, but through consistent collaboration with contributors in the DXdao community as well. Virtual retreats and happy hours have been proposed as potential opportunities to facilitate new and existing contributor unification.\n\n**What needs improvement:**\n\nDuring this proposal period we began the search for a DAO Counsel. @powers, @fluiddrop, and I conducted multiple calls with contributor applicants. However, due to the complexity of the role we were unable to successfully source a new contributor to take over this position. Since then we have found multiple candidates who can potentially fill this role, and plan to onboard them during this upcoming period.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\nThis proposal falls under the new compensation structure enacted on 01/01/2022.\n\nLevel 6 \nTime commitment- 100% \nContributing to DXdao since 3/22/2021.

I have been working in Swapr adding functionalities and additional chains.\nWhen I started working at DXdao, although I had development experience, I had no web development experience. This impacts my ability to fully contribute to the level the DAO deems necessary. I made a huge effort to learn and have been doing so from the start. I believe my performance has been improving but understandably it is not yet at a desired level. I believe that it was possible, with time, to get it to level or even find a niche where I could contribute more but at this point it is not possible.\nI believe this happened in part due to a different expectations, specifically stated above, between the DAO and myself. Open and honest communication is extremely important and I always strived to keep that as one of the virtues people saw in me while working. I believe this is one of my highlights during my tenure here, which I find unfortunate it is ending. I had hoped to learn more a contribute more to this DAO but I understand the circumstances.\nI would just like to finish by expressing that I hold DXdao and its contributors in the highest esteem.\n\nProposed Scope of Contribution:\nGoals:\n\nWrap up BNB chain\nAttend DevCon Bogota\nResponsibilities:\n\nCollaboration with the existing Swapr team\nSoftware development\nPrevious coutributions:\nProposal 1\nProposal 2\nProposal 3\nProposal 4\n\nTimeframe:\n1 month (from 18/Sep to 18/Oct)\n\nCompensation:\nExperience Level: 4\n\nTime commitment: Full-time (40h/week)\n$6,000 (DAI) distributed monthly\n$4,000 (DXD) vested continuously after a one year cliff over the two following years\n0.1667% REP + 0.3333% REP (Previous proposal was sent to DevX address)\n\nSpecifically for DXD the plan would be to transfer $1,333 after 1 year and 2,667$ vested continuously for the 2 years after, totalling a duration of 3 years.\n\nThese services are provided through DevX AG.","title":"Jorge Lopes Contributor Proposal [18 September 2022 - 18 October 2022]","hash":"QmREMGZWXuBaXdtLQTX3NUA6zK9MujoXfznkfHTYvY1CBa"},"0x05657635ff69cd94d55a4dd5a50fb76ef1063b89598f6699fe83dfeb97c46663":{"description":"In accordance with [this proposal from mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xd4d5e354fe501dbcce2b8b324c8f392490c7a3f086b4c0952356c1895d09d7fa ), this proposal will order a liquidity deposit in Swapr for 21.85 WETH, sent to the relayer by [this xDXdao proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x6734c5191278cbd5fa25fb380e794370ed53bc714bf6f737e630c88f98e9eb7f) and .7839 wBTC sent by [this xDXdao proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xd95eb12ff81ee3cf07d5e06ec7b9a56501ccca1c2200a88f856d4dc1628647d0).","title":"Provide liquidity on Swapr WETH/wBTC pair via Swapr Relayer II","hash":"QmNdP5uCtCfvpzxtUsuwhFvqigNe1A9NubPkVrbDJvaod7"},"0x05ac6f90c96c77898758d64c6ff2900bb5861084bdd66b9a6f3cec62e5437ee3":{"description":"This proposal returns 19,000 USDC & 19,000 wxdai to DXdao base from the Swapr relayer.

I did contribute articles related to specific DXdao initiatives (Badger, ENS, Carrot articles) but didn’t write any larger pieces outside of that.\n* Needs Improvement: I and the DXbiz team are having a hard time “selling” DXdao’s products to partner entities.

So far every time I do a proposal, it makes me stop and think about time and how it passes in this space. It has the strangest effect on me. It feels as though I have lived half a lifetime in the mere six months since starting with the DAO. When I look back I can barely even remember how my life was before DXdao, and the surprising thing I realize is that I have not even spent a minute thinking about it either.\n\nI had my opinions about it before I started at DXdao, and it was one of the main draws to the DAO, but the buidlers market has truly highlighted the immense talent that DXdao has amassed over the past few years. From teams building products that basically outshine competitors’ on almost every level to amazing treasury management, DXdao’s contributors are without a doubt of the highest caliber and one of the DAO’s most valuable assets. I feel privileged to be around you all and to be able to learn from you.\n\nSpeaking of which, ETHCC is a week away and it seems I will be meeting most of the remainder of the team there.

While this goal is no longer a necessity, it has without a doubt become my favorite objective. Even though this is a moving target, increasing my grasp on all things DXdao is just such a fantastic experience. The knowledge is becoming more natural to recall, and I am starting to see a future where I can freely discuss most aspects of DXdao and its products.\n\nContinue clarifying existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities and take them on as my “own”.\n\nI am really happy with my progress here. The planning and preparation has paid off, and the heavy “catch up” phase is finally over. It has allowed me space to breathe and be of use in other fields.\n\nGet to know the remaining key contributors that I have not yet met.\n\nThis has started to take on a new dimension with the deepening of ties. I am enjoying this new phase of getting to know contributors more intimately and am looking forward to continuing this in the future.\n\nWhat I think I did well in relation to my Responsibilities:\n\nContinue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere:\n\nThis remains a focal point for me and I am happy with how things are going here. I love this part of my work and actively engage in this.\n\nI made a point of focusing on the 1:10 post to engagement ratio and feel comfortable that I have finally made this part of my workflow.\n\nSocial Engagement & Communications:\n\nI have remained on top of highlighting the social engagements of DXdao, its products and contributors, and have been an integral part of contributing to the needed content relative to me.\n\nWhat I think needs improvement.\n\nTime Management:\n\nSince joining DXdao full time and without fully realizing it, I have been spending almost 10-12 hours a day sitting in front of the computer, and on many days only going to bed when the sun rises.

It was a pretty comprehensive review, that anyone can see [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-core/pull/43).\n\nI've also reveiewed the Hardhat migration of the periphery contracts [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-periphery/pull/42).\n\nAaaand I've reviewed the implementation of the new swap relayerc smart contract [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-core/pull/43).\n\nIn the month of August we also saw a hack of the fee receiver contract. I was quickly called in the war room and I was able to identify exactly how the exploit worked, which is nice. I've build a reproduction of how the hacker manager to steal the protocol fees [here](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-fee-receiver-hack) right after, with comprehensive comments explaining step by step what's happening.\n\n## Carrot\n\nIt was a busy month for Carrot because the preliminary audit report from Sigma Prime came back. I'd say overall it was pretty good with 3 mediums, 1 low and 7 informationals. No critical nor high vulns were found, which is always nice. Most of the month was then dedicated to addressing the preliminary report, working towards a final report from Sigma.\n\nOn the v1 contracts I have:\n\n- Added the minimum payout, lower and higher bound to the oracle creation script, allowing to create test ERC20 KPI tokens in a better, more complete way.\n- Remove an extra unchecked, addressing an issue in the audit report.\n- Updated the Foundry config file after a Foundry update.\n- Added gas snapshots to `gitignore`.\n- Added a bunch of minor gas optimizations.\n- Fixed a couple typos in both code and natspec doc.\n- Removed a pointless initialization check in the `finalize` function of the ERC20 KPI token.\n- Optimized storage layout a bit so that all collateral-related functions are a bit more cheap gas-wise (`recoverERC20`, `registerPostFinalizationCollateralAmounts`, `collectCollateralsAndFees`, `redeem` and others).\n- Slightly changed events structure.\n- Removed unused Solidity errors.\n- Removed some redundant checks.\n- Slightly optimized gas usage when emitting event on ERC20 token initialization.\n- Implemented a unified base template manager contract to avoid code duplication as much as possible. The base templates manager implements shared functions such as `addTemplate`, `removeTemplate`, `upgradeTemplate`, `updateTemplateSpecification`, `template` view function, and others. Each specific manager (KPI tokens and oracle) will then inherit from this base contract.\n- Reviewed the code/dir structure to account for different template manager versions. Each template manager will be immutable, but it's possible to update them to different versions by setting them in the factory contract. A bit like what Uniswap does with its router, which is immutable, but supports updated deployments.\n- Fixed the remove template logic in the base manager after the audit showed an issue.\n- Improved the documentation on the base template manager enumerate function to make it clear exactly what it does (addresses audit point).\n- Updated the Reality.eth oracle to exclusively work with Reality.eth v3 (`resultForOnceSettled` support) and avoiding unsafe typecasting in the process (addresses audit point).\n- After all the previous changes, updated the deploy script to actually work again.\n- Added a value check when instantiating oracles in the ERC20 KPI token contract, making sure that the total value that needs to be sent to oracles is actually matches by the value sent along with the tx.\n- Deployed the whole contract suite to Goerli, abandoning Rinkeby.\n\nProof [here](https://github.com/carrot-kpi/contracts-v1/commits/main?after=eb94c246a6655896e16a92684d5ae394e58f7c14+34&branch=main&author=luzzif).\n\nOn the alpha frontend I have:\n\n- Removed the previous featured campaigns\n- Added new campaigns,\n- Prepared the release of the new versions with the newly featured campaigns.\n\nProof [here](https://github.com/carrot-kpi/frontend/commits/master).\n\nOn the core SDK I have updated the IPFS gateway after issues with campaigns loading. The new version was included in the latest releases. Proof [here](https://github.com/carrot-kpi/sdk-core/commit/795edb994583cbf611ea084c534cee66203c3e55).\n\nOn the v1 SDK I have implemented major changes in structure and functionality (also added Goerli support).

We also love the branding!\n- **Content quality** - Once again I am reiterating the increased quality of content for both DXdao and its products. The upcoming landing pages and explainer videos should set a bar we have yet to reach in the past, and it has the whole team extremely excited. More concise scheduling for socials, increased outreach for Infinite drawing in a healthier group of accepted hackers, consistent Discord improvements to UX and security, etc...\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **DXvoice Organization/Leadership** - For an extended period of time I have been discussing/working on better documentation, organization and prioritization flows for DXvoice. Until this point, much of the coordination has happened simply through word of mouth or in notes, which is not scalable. This needs to be expedited. \n\n-  **DXdocs and general documentation activity/participation** - DXdocs continues to fall to the wayside, with other initiatives taking precedence.

If they diverge, the mainnet proposal takes precedent.\n\n*tldr, this proposal extends the Buyback program for 107 ETH under the conditions approved in the same conditions as previous buybacks.

While these discussing are still ongoing, this extension would allow for the program to continue. Once the 107 WETH is depleted, the DXD acquired through the Buyback Reserve may be burned\n\n## Details\n\nA separate mainnet proposal sends 107 ETH to the [ETH Relayer Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e99bed13071176fe06b317b33e2dcd1e1c9f2be), identified as `0x3e99bEd13071176fE06b317b33e2dcd1E1c9f2BE`, to be relayed to the [multi-chain multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9467dcFD4519287e3878C018c02f5670465a9003), identified as `0x9467dcFD4519287e3878C018c02f5670465a9003` where it will be wrapped and bridged over to Gnosis Chain and deposited into the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions#address-tabs), identified as `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`.

Like worker proposals the user needs to create two proposals, one at the start of the period and one at the end, but the contributor proposal opens gives more importance to the goals and forces them to be more detailed, while also allowing to have some responsibilities, to allow an easier evaluation from the dao at the end of the contributor period.\n\n## Timeframe\n\nFrom 01/09/2022 to 31/12/2022. (four months)\n\nIt was going to be a three months proposal but since we have like 15 days in Colombia in October and it is about taking over more responsabilities and a new role I thought it would be better to have a four months length proposal that finish right on the end of the year.\n\n## Proposed Scope of Contribution\n\n### Goals\n\n- Finish the dxdao governance smart contracts v2, new Avatar, Controller, Reputation, WalletScheme, and DXDVotingMachine.\n- Guide and help the dxgov team on improving the dxdao-contracts developer operations and documentation to have a simple and flexible guilds & dao deployment process.\n- Help and guide dxgov testing dxdao migration to new governance contracts v2.\n- On board a security/solidity consultant/auditor/educator into dxdao.\n- On board a solidity senior dev/tech lead into swpr with @0xVenky.\n- Kickstart cross-squad solidity collaboration.\n- Work with DXgov team in Bogota and after bogota to design a DXDVotingMachine that will support [Gov 2.0 Requirements](https://dxgovernance.github.io/dxvote/#/mainnet/proposal/0xf57b8345b7bcafdff729e2441900b5340251bcc83a4a4c48c6b273eed7ecb717)\n\n### Responsibilities\n\n- Technical Development Manager.\n\nThink of all DXdao developers being part of a football team, the team has different groups working on defense, offense, free kicks, etc. Every football team has a manager that makes sure each player is playing in the position they feel more comfortable in and where they can deliver the best for the team, sometime they might have to switch positions or help other players. The manager has the responsibility to make sure the team is going to be in the best shape possible, with high morale and a good team spirit to win as many matches as they can.\nThis is what I am proposing to start doing in dxdao, manage the developers, all our squads use a very similar programming stack (fullstack js with reactjs) and all the smart contracts are written in the same language (soidity). I have lot of experience in building applications and smart contracts while making sure they follow strong technical requirements.\nWith the help of Ross I managed to create a good technical, collaborative and hacker culture in the dxgov team, I plan to replicate it in the rest of the squads, to share as much technical stack as they can to make sure they can cross collaborate if needed and wanted, increasing their experience and strengthening community bonds.\n\nI will focus on bringing solutions to dxgov, swpr and carrot devs and team leaders, by following up as close as I can on what they are working on, how, and why.\n\nThe other very important part of this new role is to help squads establish clear goals and objectives for every period, based on the discussion had the past over the past months regarding the use of our developer resources and what are we getting from them, as development manager I will help teams sets achievable goals that will also help dxdao financially, not adding features cause they are cool, we want to build and fork cool stuff that will make us earn money and sustain our hacker culture and make our investors as happy as we can.\n\nAlso I plan to start a developer board where we will track all contributions from dxdao developers, each developer would be able to choose a contribution per month and we will do a monthly review of it, we will see something like: \nTotal issues opened/closed.\nTotal PRs merged.\nTotal lines of coded added/removed.\nSpecial mentions to contributions.\nAnd I think we can even start a developer of the month NFT where developers would vote between them and choose the dxdao dev of the month.\n\n- Maintain dxvote legacy application stability.\n- Manage and execute audits of dxdao smart contracts and products, communicating with audit firms and auditors to set up audits, and handle communications between them and dxdao squads.\n- Lead DXhackathon technical side organization of the event (talks, technical content, selection, and judging process)\n- Help @melanie to work with lateral on the dxretreat design.\n- Collaborate with @melanie to create an ongoingrecruiting strategy for Senior Solidity developers.\n- Lead weekly developer calls, have demos, cool PRs shared, and special guests, every two weeks, make them more technical/hacker focused.\n\n\n## Compensation\n\n- Estimating 100% time commitment\n- Contributor Level: 8\n- DAI : 36000 USD.\n- DXD: 19000 USD vested for 3 years with a 1 year cliff starting 01/09/2022.\n- REP: 0.32% at based on the latest REP supply on mainnet at the moment of submitting the worker payment.\n\n## Work Validation\n\nAll or most of these goals should be accomplished.\n\n- DXdao governance smart contracts audit by omega team complete.\n- ERC20Guilds smart contracts audit by sigma prime team complete.\n- DXvote minimal stable version for legacy dxdao-contracts.\n- dxdao-contracts (new dao contracts) v2 ready integrated into DAVI.\n- Start monthly dxdao developer update, share on what the developers have been working on, the pull request they selected for the developer update and the start developer of the month awards.\n- A solidity security/consultant/educator onboarded on dxdao.\n- A senior dapp developer onboarded on dxdao to work on swpr.\n- Squads collaborating with each other on solidity smart contract development/reviews.\n- Have a DXDVotingMachine smart contract ready to be audited to be used as core of DXdao Gov 2.0 Voting System.\n\n## Work Experience\n\n* 9 years as full-stack web developer, 7 years working with blockchain stuff -

Contributor event stipend\n   - $4,000 annually per full-time contributor (based on an expected contributor count of ~25 )\n- 30k - DXdao offsite\n- 20k - DXdao conference or event sponsorships\n\n**100k - Contributor event stipend**\n\nDXdao encourages its contributors to attend conferences throughout the year as they are highly beneficial. Conferences help to promote professional contributor growth, provide an opportunity for product exposure, and allow for networking. Thus, we provide an individual stipend to DXdao contributors who are interested in participating in them. Contributor event stipends will be allocated based on the following criteria:\n\n- % of time contributing to DXdao\n  - All contributors are eligible for a stipend. The % commitment to DXdao determines the stipend amount\n  - For example, 80% contribution time - $3,200 annually ($1,600 /6 mos)\n- All conference stipends must be reviewed and approved ahead of time by the ContributorX\n- The event stipend distribution will be handled individually by guilds\n- In addition, if a contributor represents DXdao and hosts a talk, panel discussion, or workshop, they are eligible for an additional stipend beyond their annual event stipend. This additional stipend will require prior approval and be claimed through the Services guild. \n\n**$30k - DXdao offsite**\n\nIn line with the DXevents proposal that passed last year, we propose to continue our annual DXretreat in 2023 and request 30k for funding this offsite, (both previous off-site allocations were for 30k.) The ContributorX will be responsible for the coordination and execution of 2023 offsite. If a remaining budget is available, it has also been discussed to explore the idea of having a technical retreat in 2023. See here for further information on the 2021 DXretreat and 2022 DXretreat.\n\n**$20k - Conference or event sponsorships**\n\nWe are proposing to allocate 20k towards potential DXdao conference or event sponsorships. The specifics of these sponsorships have not been confirmed yet by DXdao. Further details will be provided in standalone proposals for each sponsorship during the year.\n","title":"DXdao Contributor stipend and Event budget ","hash":"QmNoR3KsS1PEQ8ghFirmrdRDkAU1hpEKPZgZpfjMgkuW42"},"0x08e78c6aa36633cbf48e2fa5d00332980da6886e3833d69fb5f3840a91d6b6aa":{"description":"Proposal to remove DaoDeployer2 0x63F411E7cA67CB296FE2c7B875E072E82A609436\n\nThis proposal is created following a schemes cleaning operation discussed in the daotalk forum on the topic https://daotalk.org/t/remove-old-schemes-mainnet-gnosischain/4209","title":"Remove DaoDeployer2 0x63F411E7cA67CB296FE2c7B875E072E82A609436","hash":"QmPRM7Hhp8mmtM3LCVyy398eCzwxBEkL3jZdy2t78BVW3p"},"0x093b73e99bb222a0c80e5b65c58ffe46b9d11fbe9a38f75b5a28ba8b2d7b4972":{"description":"This proposal launches a LINK / GNO farming campaign that starts Thu Mar 17th 2022 at 15:00 and ends Thu Apr 14th 2022 at 15:00; distributing 6,720 SWPR tokens, 3.625 GNO and 3.625 \"GNO Swapr GC TVL 04-14\" Carrot tokens over that time period.\n\n \nREP holders approved the SWPR token and farming campaigns through a [signal proposal that passed in August of 2021](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x2d00135332c28271ba27c6f02f9aa79a480b4d7c58df37fb30e6a55353470910).

Full-time with 40 workable days/2 months\n\nPosition : Lead of DXvoice squad\n\nDAOtalk thread: https://daotalk.org/t/keenan-luke-contributor-proposal-for-07-2021-to-09-2021/3140\n\n### **In reflection of my proposal, July - Sept 1, what I think I did well includes:**\n\n**Preparing DXdao and Swapr community facets for potential growth. **\n\nIn preparation for the, at the time, upcoming Swapr Arbitrum release and token launch I had prepared full overhauls of our most common community outlets. This includes Discord navigation, permissions, verification systems, ticketing procedure, moderation delegation, presented information/links, and much more. This was a large success, seeing a massive increase in active accounts and incoming messaging. Big shoutout to @arhat for his deep attention to these channels during the launch period, especially in my absence.\n\n**Assisting in the facilitation of the SWPR token launch. **\n\nWe launched the SWPR token this period, which was already an incredibly demanding task in itself. On top of this, a deployment hitch caused the necessity of a token migration and contract redeployment. I don’t think I did a good job specifically here, I think that everyone involved in the process from technical to non-technical did an absolutely fantastic job. As for my personal accomplishments in this process, I handled much of the communication strategy surrounding the original launch and subsequent redeployment/migration, marketing materials/post coordination, tokenomics, farming plans and proposal preparation.\n\n### **What I think I could improve on:**\n\n**Despite the glaring reason of why, I felt I did not do a good enough job managing DXdocs this period. **\n\nThe SWPR launch was incredibly time consuming and left too few gaps to get a comprehensive update out for when I had originally hoped. This will be a priority for me in the coming weeks, including but not limited to intrasquad coordination of technical documentation and roadmapping.\n\n### Compensation:\n\nI took two weeks of \"reduced time\" this proposal period. Due to the nature of the SWPR launch and how busy we were all around, I ended up committing 70% during this window, which was confirmed with a handful of contributors familiar with the situation. I also purchased a work laptop. DXdao tech reimbursment wen?\n\nExperience Level: 4\nFull-time.\n#### Month one.\n$5,250 + 36 (xDai).

Vested for 2 years.\n\n0.141695% REP.\n\n$81 accounts for the previously specified $36 monthly community tool costs (statbot, yagpdb, etc…), as well as a new $45 monthly expenditure of Discord boosts to attain level 2 (Better audio quality, banner, community server status, etc). Although these community costs are still small, I would like to transition these to either their own proposal or the multi-sig as the costs grow - bonus benefit of deeper accountability and a trail that can be followed if I were to disappear.\n\nThis proposal requests Month two’s xDai, and 0.26672% mainnet REP on xDai at the end of the period. This proposal also specifys an owe of 0.26672% mainnet REP, and owed $4,250 DXD based on ATH price.","title":"Keenan Luke Contributor Proposal for 07/2021 to 09/2021 2/2","hash":"QmYmytQngMBwA8HKpJVchniptXPE3eRDdKvW4CZbncqju3"},"0x0e34cc195b3aea72307474815b81cb80a1eb9e38281e068e85f66baa9f94c924":{"description":"I am submitting a proposal for current ongoing and future contributions to DXdao that started on July 1st, 2022, and will end on August 31, 2022.

The mistakes were most likely calculation errors as I was doing things manually – this has led me to start re-thinking my process for collecting and calculating data for contributors. Clearly doing things manually can lead to mistakes – going forward I am going to spend more time learning how to automate processes as well as learn how to use excel/google sheets in a more accurate manner.

The 2 month of the proposal went very well according to planning for creating new features, bugs fixing and all the architecting + developing efforts. I worked mainly on DXvote for UI/UX improvements, maintainabilty and optimizatins refactorings. I also worked on Guilds new app architecting and developing UI/UX.\n\nReflections: \n- The things went very well as planed. A lot of the work of DXvote delivered as a nicer UI/UX in the list of proposals, the filters of proposals, and the proposal detail view. \n- The internal refactor also went well as planed, thanks a lot to great team managment by Ross, and great dev mates that aligned their reviews and their implementations of refactor with this scope.\n- I gained a lot of knowledge on web3 standards and the way apps fetch data from the blockchain, and call functions in the smart contracts. I gain understanding of the blockchain itself, and checking other people PRs helped me to understand better the theory I was learning through the documentations. \n- The participation on the meetings was very interesting. I wasn't able to provide much feedback or brainstorming at high business level, but I put all my focus and efforts into engineering: architecting the front end (based on what I disliked on DXvote) for Guilds and DXvote refactors, rewriting markup and styles for better maintainance, debugging and fixing bugs of DXvote and good collaborative discussions with designers and other devs regarding new features. \n\nA brief list of PRs on DXvote and Guilds I worked on this period: \nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/440\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/452\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/456\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/461\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/455\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/448\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/433\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/389\n\n\nThe contribution reward proposed was: \n\n2 week trial period (Level 3 at 50%)\n$1,500 DAI\n$1,000 DXD in a vesting contract continuously for two years with a one year cliff\n0.0417% REP (697.2)\n\nMonth 1 (Level 3 at 80%)\n$4800 DAI\n$3,200 DXD in a vesting contract continuously for two years with a one year cliff\n0.1333% REP (2,229.92)\n\nMonth 2 (Level 3 at 80%)\n$ 4800 DAI\n$3,200 DXD in a vesting contract continuously for two years with a one year cliff\n0.1333% REP (2,229.92)\n\nI got executed till the moment 6300 xDAI (training + 1 month). \n\nThis payment proposal then is for second month of the period (Month 2): \n- 4800 DAI\n\n\n\n","title":"Luchux - Payment Proposal, November 15th 2021 - December 15th 2021.","hash":"QmVaLT2wGnCoLpBkS1yrJaWQnPmcnjna6TWBTN3Dnxb14S"},"0x121a42a6eb780104b0984a9a5983794b16eac3271687af2521a5489764d6faad":{"description":"\n    \nThis proposal places a 4 WETH order on CowSwap for DXD.

The corresponding [mainnet proposal is here](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0xa637da9c7b3ec15cf1220bb90b94f181d335a3403f6f4b78e6c58874adf99fba).\n\n**Background**\n\nThe [DXD Buyback Program](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) was passed by REP holders in May of this year. Since then, 6,313 DXD have been purchased on mainnet and xDai for an [average price of 0.152 ETH/DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing). Using the USD price at the time of purchase, $2.7m of DXD has been purchased. This is just over 10% of the DXD circulating supply. \n\nThe [buyback program was updated](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153) in June to increase the slippage tolerance of trades as well as clarify the accounting measures. The[ buyback program was then extended](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x6f4bb1bb12469639b4af6f67ee04b174b07df211b3de45e6254de65082446af0) for another $1m in August and [then another $1m in September](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d). The total amount of DXD purchased is quickly approaching the limit placed on it by the previous proposal and soft community consensus has demonstrated support for another $1m extension.\n\nAccounting for the 6,313 DXD purchased and the 920 DXD that has been issued to contributors in vested contracts (461.4) and to LPs for Swapr farming rewards (458.6), the outstanding DXD supply (43,583) represents a market cap of [$30m](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dxdao#markets) - still comfortably below the [$64.5m in ETH and stables in the DXdao treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) and [the $10m in the buyback reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521). The buyback program is intended to address this discrepancy and acquire an undervalued asset.\n\nThe [proposed DXD token model ](https://daotalk.org/t/proposed-dxd-token-model/2898)that has been embraced by the community intends to upgrade the DXD bonding curve and shift to a different buyback method for DXD. While the community moves toward a new model, the methods outlined in the DXD Buyback Program and purchases through the [GP Relayer](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmd8TCEr6syKxAnmuBH3hsyvxfSgRJgANLTTorp3JGZY77) on xDai and Mainnet enable DXdao to drive value to DXD holders now. There has [also been discussion](https://daotalk.org/t/expand-dxd-buyback-purchase-options/3380) in the community about shifting the buyback program to Aqua or another relayer that could interact directly with Swapr.\n\n**Details**\n\nThis proposal extends the DXD Buyback Program for another $1m to $4m total under the same conditions outlined in the original [Buyback Program signal proposal](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8), [the parameter update](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153) and the [first extension](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x6f4bb1bb12469639b4af6f67ee04b174b07df211b3de45e6254de65082446af0) and [second extension](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d).\n\nThese and other DXD purchases through the Buyback Program have contributed to the community’s intention to use the buyback reserve to purchase DXD. ETH from [DXdao’s general treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) can be used in lieu of the buyback reserve until the DXD token contract is upgraded and that ETH is recovered. In total, the [buyback reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521) has 2,499 ETH and so far, 958 ETH has been used to purchase 6,313 DXD through the buyback program.\n\n**Risks and considerations**\n\nThe program will take place on xDai, a sidechain with less security properties than Ethereum. The Buyback Program has been running for four months with few problems; the GP Relayer has worked to complete the purchases at the market price. There is a concern that Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai will have limited support, but DXdao community members are striving to maintain the network of solvers. The community is also exploring additional options. \n\nDXdao has already spent almost $2.6m repurchasing DXD. This has increased the price of DXD relative to ETH but it still falls below the book value of ETH in the treasury.","title":"DXD Buyback Program Extension #3","hash":"QmRmTUCZq8TN7pko2QYswDWEg2mHAuyjy5zeRBsNsiVSzC"},"0x16caebacf5fe49585dd25399006f1a2efdb26da67ed41999845c801865aac1e8":{"description":"As per the original worker proposal’s terms (visible [here](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/xdai/proposal/0x9f7d5511af36b7eff3faac64420e6f535ac289735bae4a021854fcd94904b165)), I’m asking for 8k xDai.\n\n## Proof of work\n\n#### Carrot frontend\n\n- Added support for IPFS cids as questions. The frontend automatically fetches the data from IPFS and shows it to the user. This lets Carrot creators come up with much more complex/long questions and explain in much more detail how the answer can be determined.\n- Implemented Reality.eth question answering form with the help of Milan. Questions can now be answered directly from the Carrot frontend as soon as a KPI expires, instead of being redirected to Reality.eth to submit the answer. The form changes depending on if a scalar or boolean market is being answered. \n- Generally improved UI/edge cases fixing.\n- Improved responsiveness overall.\n- Replaced the wallet modal with a new, more compact wallet popover that shows the connected address (with the ability to copy it to the clipboard) and pending/submitted transactions (with a link to check them out on a block explorer).\n- Only shown production networks on non-dev builds in network switcher popover.\n- Added \"A DXdao product\" text to all the popovers' footer.\n- Added Swapr as a price source too.\n- Added a \"holding\" badge to campaigns in the homepage when the connected account is currently holding tokens for a specific featured campaign.\n- Added support for ENS name reverse lookup and avatar record fetching to show each user's on-chain identity on the frontend, when available, for a more personalized experience. \n\nProof [here](https://github.com/Carrot-KPIs/carrot-frontend/commits/master?author=luzzif&before=1518ddbfef31b244f578184ae97a69c8b8843fbb+105&branch=master).\n\n#### Carrot subgraph\n\n- Throw when no Reality.eth question linked to the KPI token can be found.\n- Updated the factory's address on xDai.\n\nProof [here](https://github.com/Carrot-KPIs/carrot-subgraph/commits/master).\n\n#### Carrot smart contract\n\nOn the smart contracts I've mainly worked on improving some tasks used for testing out the platform. Proof [here](https://github.com/Carrot-KPIs/carrot-contracts/commits/master).\n\n#### DXdao landing page\n\nBrought reproducible, deterministic builds (and in turn IPFS CIDs) to DXdao's new landing page, making its publishing on the official DXdao ENS name verifiable by anyone. Proof [here](https://github.com/KeenanLukeOM/DXdaoLandingPage/commits/main?author=luzzif).\n\n#### Swapr Coingecko API\n\nAdded an endpoint to fetch uncollected protocol fees sitting in the fee receivers on each supported networks. Proof [here](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-coingecko/commits/master?author=luzzif).\n\n#### Swapr farming contracts\n\nIntegrated update developed by Kaden allowing the owner of the campaign to top up the rewards mid-way. An audit has been performed on these changes but still has to be reviewed. Proof [here](https://github.com/luzzif/erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts/commits/master?before=ee0605eee011394af82b90f407a9393e17e358fc+35&branch=master&author=luzzif).\n\n#### Swapr governance\n\nWhile waiting for the Swapr guild to go live, I've implemented a custom Snapshot strategy for Swapr taking into account held, LPd and staked LPd Swapr. The strategy has been used for a couple of proposals. Proof [here](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/commit/406b7b4210d2717f3ad7748b2f9eb7d80a509998).\n\n#### Other\n\nI've also started working on a new product to incentivize automatic smart contract executions through cryptoeconomic incentives called Jolt, that will be instrumental in building the vision for Carrot v1, but to also potentially be implemented in other DXdao's product as a powerful infrastructural piece owned by the community.","title":"DAI payout (26/10/2021-26/11/2021) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmR88DdBdtpr4z61h4r2zYLSHmM5fPj3sEFWfQdvgiGGPa"},"0x16e7b21013503f6234fd7a0f5979ad03d8e5116c7615c2da9c6ffd696287d85b":{"description":"\n    \nThis proposal places a 4 WETH order on CowSwap for DXD.

11/12/2021, 2 months\n\n**Position:** Contributor\n\n**Background:**\n\nSince my last proposal, I have mainly focused on legal and compliance questions for DXdao.\n\n**80% Legal and Compliance:**\n\n- Create legal budget covering a variety of needs for DXdao and execute on those areas. See Proposal 1. ​​\n- Continued contributor assistance with company formation and immigration questions.\n- Explore solutions to Contributor Invoicing issues and legal entity formation.\n- Create proposal on Self-Insurance Fund to cover potential defenses and damages in a suit or regulatory action.\n- LisCON networking with various DAO legal advisors on areas of interest that could helps with DXdao’s needs.\n\n**15% DXventures / DXbiz**\n\n- Attend and review pitches for DXventures.\n- Network with DeFI community projects for possible opportunities for collaboration with DXdao.\n- Draft and review terms for any grant proposals for DXventures.\n\n**5% Omen:**\n\n- Finish the creation of the Omen video for the landing page with Ilio.\n\n**Self Evaluation:** The following is a self-evaluation on what I’ve done well, okay, and not well. This work proposal is coming at a week before the end of the current proposed work period. So it will be evaluating the proposed projects and deliverables stated above.\n\n**Did Well:**\n\n- Creating a Q4 budget was very nice to organize and plan DXdao legal priorities for the end of the year. Each item is currently being worked on, with the exception of the blockchain analysis. I’ve had a really difficult time pinning down the firm to a price, and may be exploring other options.\n- The UK opinion has been delivered, advice from Polsinelli has been useful, and steps to start the exploration with MME are underway, but not yet initiated.\n- A big step in progress in this work period has been around contributor payments, immigration, and a potential Self-Insurance fund. These are all areas that I think will help DXdao scale and sustainably grow.\n- Also, please look out for a proposal to cover a retroactive stipend to cover costs for setting up a legal entity to interact with the DAO. The aim is to incentivize DXdao contributors to set these entities up as a healthy method to interact not just with this DAO, but all DAOs.\n\n**Did Okay:** \n- Getting feedback on product development has been active, but more streamlined processes with individual product leads need to be developed to assess legal needs and find the proper contractors to cover any missing gaps. I’m happy to have started creating those channels, with DXvote, for example, but more needs to be done to assess and stay up-to-date on the product side. More regular and streamlined communication with product leads, perhaps a 30 minute weekly check-in, could be a nice step.\n\n**Needs Improvement:**\n- I’m late on this proposal, very late. I know we’ve discussed a potential deduction in payment for late proposals. I would be okay with accepting a deduction if others think it’s a good idea to do so.\n- I have also backed off on some of my responsibilities with DXventures in order to focus more on general DAO legal structuring and narrow my focus. The Chainverse proposal was a missed opportunity IMO, and I still need to make a formal proposal for Atlantis World. - - This may come before the work period is over, but it should have been done sooner.\n- Clearer documentation on the Contributor UX side for legal resources needs to be thought about. There’s a lot of ad hoc answering of questions happening, but some basic materials in the DXdocs could help some through basic questions.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\nExperience Level: 5\n\nFull-time for total of 40 hours per week, for two months (9.13.21 - 11.12.21).\n\n$16,000 (DAI) to be paid at the end of the work period\n$12,000 (DXD). $6,000 (DXD) vested at 1 year, and continued vesting after the first year on a linear schedule.\n0.3334% REP\n\n**Additional Requests for Reimbursement:**\n\n- LisCON + DXRetreat Travel ($300 – rental car) and Stay Stipend ($800): $1100\n- Reimbursement for the cost of 3 months of the Bloomberg Law Subscription (legal research tool) : $1738\nI presented obtaining this subscription about six months back during a governance call. I use this to research topics on legal questions for DXdao. I’ve claimed a reimbursement for it once previously. I’ve found it helpful to have the most accurate and up-to-date information on fintech legal issues, as well as see what other projects have been doing for legal frameworks.\n\nI joined DXdao as a part-time contributor as of 12/12/20.

Likely some additional governance due to support of GGG: Patron (does not have a set governance reward; TBD by Dawn)\n\nThis docs also provides some answers to our follow-up questions: [Ministry clarifications for DXdao](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZnIlNFb831clZPZJrbkmlWckhGv_4Cxl59q1zhZ7lRg/edit)\n\nIn Dawn, 6 Core Tokens have been given to core DAOist contributors.\n\nThe Core token is conditionally granted to people who are devoting most of their time to the project, ideally full time or at least 50% of their work capacity and participating in the specific verticals of the project.\n\nThese people are:\n- Elco, (born Felipe Duarte)\n- Inga Vyugova\n- Luuk Weber\n- Numa Oliveira\n- Guil\n- Stefen Deleveaux\n\n$280k (about 34%) of the $825k funding will fund the **larger** core team to advance The DAOist.\n\nUPDATE from THE DAOist:\n\"**Q: Does the core team have their own ideas for future creations and opportunities?**  \nA: The Core team funding is actually misnamed - it's \"all team funding\" = since the creation of that deck the team has grown around 2x between events support and local comms / production team in Portugal\n\n**Q: Are there plans from The DAOist team?**\nA: We have several ideas underway on the 3 tracks of Tech, Art/Culture, and Governance - Looking forward to being able to put them on a roadmap and check warmness with the community - initial planned use of Dawn will be related to setting the political frame and main agreements as per stated in the governing Dawn article, but governance holders can make their own proposals.\"\n\n**Some reasons to support:**\n\n1. Lean into The DAOist and Dawn as one of the best DAO-focused orgs and events organizer in the space, plus more\n2. Additional voting power in the Dawn DAO that sets the future path of what The DAOist does\n3. Optimal access to future events\n4. Additional Perks:\n\n**What governance is included with the Ministry package?**\n\n* Ministry Badge NFT for your organization + Set of Delegate NFTs totaling 50 votes (25+25)\n* Delegate tokens remain transferable\n\n**What DAOist event perks are included for Ministries?**\n\n* Priority access to additional DAOist tickets before releasing to the general public. (The DAOist events are often free and curated - by securing a ministry you know you will always be in)\n\n**What Lisbon Metahub perks are included for Ministries?**\n\n* Coworking + Dormitory access for “delegate” token holders (subject to availability)\n* Priority for ‘Residency Program’ agenda setting - effectively a perennial plug and play off site space for inter and intra team collaboration to speed up your projects ship rate - including on staff documentation team to publish the process and results of the co creation.\n\n**Will the Ministry slot need to be re-purchased at a later date?**\n\n* The benefits described here do not have an expiration date. The runway generated by this sponsorship set should be able to fund the DAOist’s path to sustainability by fleshing out several revenue streams with events, services and products instead of resales involving Dawn Governance.\n* Any other decisions will be made by the DAO. It will still retain 49.6% of the total agreed supply of governance power after sponsorship slots are sold.\n\n5. Continue to build a much stronger network of DAO-focused entities in the space.\n\n**Some costs / risks:**\n\n1. Cost would be $25k tribute to have this spot in Dawn\n2. How to determine delegates to represent DXdao in Dawn. DXdao has not done much like this, but it IS something DXdao should get much better at -> delegating representation into other communities\n3. Unsure of use of some of the benefits - because the Metahub is regional, may only be available to be taken advantage of by select few contributors\n\nThe entire space needs more high quality events around DAOs and these events need participants who are leading the way in decentralization.  Supporting this initiative would allow DXdao to continue to set examples and share its ideas with the community.   \n\nIf you support this Opportunity, please signal your support by vote.  \n","title":"Signal Proposal: DXdao to commit to Ministry position in Dawn DAO organized by The DAOist","hash":"QmWntW4o6Tkcnm6BGAHT5M3nik9r1tnVvPDX9gtYAnxenS"},"0x1dc72b2d3c194b51edd8df9c92fbf51826a8ed24801a2f7cd3e055da64d2f6d8":{"description":"Current Mainnet REP: 31,315\nCurrent xDai REP: 15,325\nRequested REP amount: 15,990\n\nBoth REP held at the same address on main net and xDai","title":"Caney Fork - xDXdao REP request to match current mainnet REP","hash":"QmeyuGXjzqi1wNYJErCPCHjHJCEdReF7CwjZXKLFYEmw2z"},"0x1e7d38e8304622e542921b5f8004c78be97081f28990c5be022d6e3eda43d670":{"description":"**DXColombia Contributor Stipend and travel request by MilanV\n**\n- Transportation to Bogotá from Europe - $1,200\n- Transportation Bogotá - Cartagena return ticket - $200\n- Accommodation - $2,100\n- Daily stipend - $1,125\n- DevCon - $299\n\n**DXColombia Total: $5,050**\n\nPayout Request in this Proposal: **5,050 xDAI**","title":"MilanV - DXColombia Contributor Stipend Request","hash":"QmNWzdcmagx1KAw2tPe8SPqKZeJr8FWw9AciRnyrY4tV91"},"0x1eb7de4c48678981c2effae70cc22ef83dde59e02d76a63e7cb3f6cbfce78d42":{"description":"*Below is a proposal outlining a request for recruiting funds at DXdao*\n\n**Background**\n\nTo aid the efforts to grow our community, DXdao should take every opportunity to bring attention to our open contributor positions.

It has led Melanie and I towards discussions of changes that need to be made regarding the processes within ContributorX and how we advise, guide, and provide for DXdao’s contributors. We are constantly discussing what we could do better as individuals who operate for the people, and what processes we can make easier and more efficient.\n\nRecently, we have been discussing some changes to contributor guidelines, specifically the proposal process, in which the first post can be found here . The next post within this series is set to be up within the next week or so – we are really hoping to get a lot of feedback on this next post in order to get the best feel for what our peers want. We have also been discussing mediation processes in the sense of ‘What can we do to promote communication between our contributors? What can we do to encourage the use of internal squad review processes? What can we do, as moderators of contributor experience, to mediate and aid these conversations which at times will be difficult?’ and so forth.\n\nI am trying to use my knowledge of counselling to find more innovative and personal ways to adapt traditional human resources to better fit our dao. Of course, it is a misstep on my part that some of these processes were not introduced/corrected sooner – however, I think it is important to think about what we can improve going forward, and how I can be more proactive rather than reactive. A goal of mine for this next period is to continue to build my relationships and rapport with my fellow contributors in order to create a better environment of trust and understanding. I wish for everyone to receive and feel the full value of having a contributor experience squad as part of their dao :slight_smile:\n\n**Compensation**\n\nExperience Level 3\n\nTime Commitment 50% (I am fully available, if I am needed for more the change in time will be reflected at the end of this period)\n\nMonth One (October)\n\n$2,500 (xDai)\n$1,500 (DXD)\n0.08335% Mainnet REP\n\nMonth Two (November)\n\n$2,500 (xDai)\n$1,500 (DXD)\n0.08335% Mainnet REP\n\nThis proposal requests xDai for Month one (October 2022).

The development teams were consolidated, and I shifted to work on DXvote instead of Aqua. The first weeks of September was spent on getting Aqua MVP done and getting it into a state we can resume development from, in the future.\n\nIt took quite a bit of time for me to get up to speed on DXvote development, especially because I was still working part-time in September. I had to take the whole week off in the last week of September, due to the transition from my previous workplace, before finally going full-time in October.\n\nThe newly assembled DXvote team has managed to rapidly adapt and ship multiple releases. We have a roadmap in place, and we’re continuing to work towards the Guilds release and Governance 2.0.\n\n### Retrospective\n\n**Did well:**\n\nWe were able to get Aqua to a good state to resume from.\nBuilt network switching and wallet connectivity features for DXvote.\nI ported over the IPFS deployment pipelines from Aqua to DXvote, and mostly rewrote it again to support our use cases in DXvote. I had to push GitHub pipelines to its limits to get it done, but now it’s working great.\n\n**Did okay:**\n\nTransition into DXvote took time, but at the end of the day, I’m happy about the state right now.\nTransitioning from my previous company took way more time and effort than I anticipated.\n\n**Improve on:**\n\nI’ve taken a backseat with DXvote’s general direction so far. This was mostly due to the whole project being new to me, but I should improve on in the future.\n\n### Some notable PRs from the last two months\n\n- [Adding WalletConnect support to DXvote](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/145)\n- [Network switching](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/217)\n- [IPFS deployment setup](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/271)\n- [DXvote loading screen everyone seems to love](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/276)\n- [Fair sale bidding in Aqua](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/aqua-interface/pull/457)\n\n**Compensation**\n\nBecause I took my payment in September at a 37.5% rate but couldn’t work in the last week, I will be reducing my second month compensation to 90% from the full-time rate. The second month compensation will be as follows:\n\n- $5400 DAI ($6000 DAI * 90%) to be sent on the second payment proposal\n- $3600 DXD ($4000 DXD * 90%) in a vesting contract continuously for two years with a one year cliff, when the work agreement finishes (31/10/21)\n- 0.15% REP (0.1667 * 90%), to be sent on the second payment proposal","title":"Madusha - Contributor Proposal [30/08/2021 - 31/10/2021] - Second Half","hash":"QmVQSM2ycLcTGffA9rJh3fga3MGWLnxUEkAzqMDEUA9Q4i"},"0x1fe7d4a7baa0ccc75b3640d3be0abda448afcd6754f20b6cfe755a45b87e6aa4":{"description":"**Timeframe**\n\nJanuary 24 2022 to March 18 2022, 2 months\n\n**Background and Responsibilities**\n\nI will continue filling my position as a part time contributor within the Contributor UX Squad, as an assistant to Melanie.

My previous work with the DAO can be easily seen and judged by looking at my past payment proposals (which include a proof of work):\n\n- [03/25/2021-04/25/2021](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xb8e57bc8313db906677fcb06530ad67f1392829de13dccee839ee3311c02facd)\n- [02/25/2021-03/25/2021](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x694cb019e59e5ff4587e959cd02773364d9068cba2414a592e3eaead425d6035)\n- [01/25/2021-02/25/2021](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc3050afc44931813599d7e6e2f003f76af6736c1bdebdc37c26a32a6f3d0854d)\n- [12/25/2020-01/25/2021](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xdc9800d7ed2dd8f3fe704aa067a14f3b18750374b4f9882da51cf99d495b2817)\n- [11/25/2020-12/25/2020](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xf187e4d6a57a84ee752af49edb99336253cb168807cfa0a600496db6a4d08433)\n- [10/25/2020-11/25/2020](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x9f6fadf9a43e28bb6563b212fdd1d5113761b151d402d9e280fcb1071cc03fb0)\n\n---\n\n## First payment proposal\nSince I’m extremely late with the proposal and the first month has already passed, I’m already requesting my first xDAI payout for the work done between May 26th and June 26th 2021.\n\nIn this period of time, I’ve taken some time off between June 16th and 26th (8 working days in total).\nSince the full working period had 22 working days in total, I’m asking for 63.63% of the total payout.\nAs per the original proposal’s term, and taking into account the vacation period, I’m hence asking for 5090.4 xDAI in total.\n\n### Proof of work\nI’ve focused on Swapr and on a new product, Carrot (for which the code is currently private) and in particular I have:\n\n- Finalized the multi-list token picker. The feature makes the user choose between different token list, and also improves token discoverability dramatically by making the user aware of tokens currently present in inactive lists, prompting them to import them in their currently active workspace if they’re interested. The feature also sped up Swapr considerably, avoiding to load token data en masse from the blockchain everytime a user lands on Swapr (for each supported chain too).\n- Made xDai and mainnet addresses for staking contracts settable through envs. This enabled the community to anonymously deploy the related smart contracts on xDai and mainnet and then do a proposal to deploy the Swapr frontend itself with the updated pointers.\n- Prepared the Swapr release on Github and signalled to the community on Keybase that Swapr beta was ready to be deployed by one of them.\n- Worked on a new product, Carrot, to enable easy KPI tokens and subsequently conditional farming on Swapr. The product is currently under active development, even though the smart contracts have received a successful audit (no major or intermediate-level vulnerability found). Currently working on the frontend and subgraph to make this a reality.\n- Also worked on a DXdao treasury dashboard, which displays a breakdown of the DAO’s treasury among all the different deployment networks. The repo for it is visible [here](https://github.com/luzzif/dxdao-treasury-dashboard). It’s currently functional, even though the plan is to include it in DXvote.\n\nThe proof regarding the claims above can be seen on Github, particularly [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/commits/develop?author=luzzif) regarding Swapr. Carrot-related proof is not currently available, since the code is private, but I’ve demoed a super early version of the thing in a dev call.","title":"Worker proposal (26/05/2021 to 26/07/2021) and first payment (26/05/2021 to 26/06/2021) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmQTEGxn8EUgn8mE9yd79QTeMtDrL87JmCnig8aaYF8TpL"},"0x20c2d20f6201e1f92ee1b72d88165634cb35626f3a7cdc3041fff6b73ea2a28e":{"description":"As per the original worker proposal's terms (visible [here](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x2fce3ef203d5aaf31372fa60b55e89be1656336425d6531dea7126b65616ead2)), I'm asking for 8k DAI in total.\n\n## Proof of work\nI've focused on Swapr this past month, and in particular I have:\n\n- Implemented a new dedicated page for liquidity mining campaigns, making the overall farming experience nicer, and allowing for a simpler displaying of campaign data (and also avoiding double modals). Proof can be found [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/260) for the initial implementation, and [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/269) for the subsequent redesign/semplification.\n\n- Implemented gas fees estimation on mainnet. The user has a new setting through which to specify the desired gas price to be used for a trade on mainnet. Additionally, GasNow's websocket API is used to fetch updated gas price data every 8 seconds, and the user can switch freely between the instant, fast and normal estimations offered by GasNow. If a user chooses one of these 3 options, the gas price will be kept up to date automatically from the fetched data, but there's also the option to specify a manual gas price in gwei (this gas price will remain static when selected). On any network other than ETH mainnet, the setting is not displayed due to the unimportance of gas fees, which become negligible. Gas estimation is done for each trade subject to ecorouting. The feature becomes useful mainly when trades on different platforms follow different routes, in order to check out the network fee linked to each operation. Gas fees shown are result of calls to `eth_estimateGas` plus a 10% margin in order to avoid out of gas errors, since the gas calculation performed by the RPC API is not 100% precise all the time (the user will get reimbursed the extra gas anyway, if the operation succeeds). The gas estimation won't work if an error in the simulated transaction is detected (for example if the user hasn't approved the necessary tokens, or if funds are not enough), or if the user is not connected to the dapp. In these cases an explicit warning message is shown. Proof of work can be found [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/267).\n\n- Focused on farming smart contracts, which are now finalized. A lot of code cleaning and gas optimization has been done, and the latest full audit did not highlight any major or even moderate issue. The contracts are pretty much finalized, and integration testing is going on. Proof of work [here](https://github.com/luzzif/erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts/commits/master).\n\n- Worked (and currently still working) on bringing the multi-list token picker experience from Uniswap to Swapr. Porting the current DXdao token system to the Uniswap standard has been a focus too. Ideally, we would pin a correctly-formatted JSON token list to IPFS and point a swapr.eth subdomain to it in order to officially have a Swapr multichain-ready token list. This brings improved performance to Swapr, not having to query the blockchain for supported ERC20 addresses, and then having again to perform another query to fetch name, symbol and decimals for these tokens on-chain. Proof of work can be seen [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/275). \n","title":"DAI payout (26/04/2021-26/05/2021) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmZ6HXbTiqyaRwXWcAudgfSXiQSKeeCcmVhdcaTrCVgc95"},"0x20fb42ccf2236500edb5f49e87fe4160ec898a34caf1d1eb58a6dddf2f6c85b4":{"description":"Here comes the Payout for April and May.\nWorker Proposal: https://daotalk.org/t/zett-proposal-april-may-2021-ft-product-owner-ui-ux/2896\n\n**Recap of this period:**\n**Swapr:**\nMain focus was getting Swapr Beta ready. We got the farming UI and contracts ready and started testing it internally. We also did an external farming campaign to close community through swapr.dev. All campaigns were successful.\nWe decided to postpone the Beta launch until we got another audit, because of all the edits and changes we made, we didn't want to risk it.\n\nWe made several UI/UX improvements and added a lot of markets to our Swapr Router.

Oleksandr is a front end developer and dev lead at Ethworks.\n\n**Communications/Marketing:**\nOur effort to push for a branding refresh for DXdao ended in an effort to only produce a Landing page with our old brand.\nThe main goal was to have a new landing page and the rebranding took over and time was spent on making involved parties happy. And as a designer I know it’s almost impossible to make everyone happy. People have different taste and vision of what a rebrand is.\nThe decision was to move on with the landing page and make a bigger out of the rebranding separated from the landing page work.

This included pulling all REP holder addresses and addresses of wallets that participated in the DXD bonding curve, screening them with blockchain investigations software, breaking down the results by risk score, and manually investigating wallet addresses the software scored as risky.\n\n(-) Struggled to generate useful analysis on LPs to Omen. When I began, I was unable to query several relevant contracts in Dune Analytics (was receiving a permission denied error that no one was able to decipher). About a month and a half later I was able to query the contracts, but struggled to associate the addresses emitted by the contracts with the party ultimately responsible for effectuating the transactions. I asked for help from several Omen squad members: @KadenZipfel provided some help, but I struggled to implement some of his suggestions. I also reached out to @0xVenky but I missed the first call we had scheduled, and he has been very busy with other Omen related tasks since.\n\nLessons learned:\n\n    15 hours a week is unrealistic : While I have worked 15 hours a week some weeks, specifically during the blockchain investigation, most weeks I have worked closer to 6-7 hours a week (because I was blocked technically or waiting for folks to get back to me with guidance/feedback). I spent a lot of that time debugging errors in Dune Analytics and The Graph. So, my next worker proposal will be for 5 hours a week. I think I might end up working more than that, and if I am, I can adjust in a future worker proposal.\n\n    Bringing on support for technical tasks: The Omen team is very busy and I don’t think it’s realistic to receive hand-holding on analytics tasks. To that end I have identified a data engineer and a machine learning engineer who are interested in Web3 governance and prediction markets respectively. I will work with the machine learning engineer to generate those metrics. I will also work with the data engineer to develop metrics on REP holder engagement for a project @Tammy is working on.

We of course had the holidays which I was mostly working over and then I spent a lot of time moving to Lisbon.\n\n**Did well:\n**\n\nKeeping up with everything - Despite having a busy time moving countries I think I still did a decent job of keeping on top of all my usual tasks and dont think much was really affected as I found time to work at close to my usual hours\nTaking a break - With moving to Lisbon my girlfriend also had a chance to come over to visit and have not seen her in over a year I took a week off. I was glad to be able to actually keep myself away from work and since I put more work in the previous week everything was prepared for DXgov to continue working smoothly.\nProgress on guilds - I’m really pleased with how work is continuing on guilds and we made a lot of leaps in this time period. We went through a few iterations of\nDocumentation - Although not live as of right now, there will be a large update to DXdocs soon that will include a large amount of DXgov documentation which I spent a good amount of time compiling. This should act as a good resource to point community members to as well as helping faster onboard new contributors to the DXgov team.\nDXgov esports - Although Dave did all the heavy lifting with this it was nice to be along for the ride and helping brainstorm the huge potential the Copenhagen flames sponsorship\nFinally after it being a note in my proposals for essentially the entirety of my time at DXdao, I finally have made a merged change into some smart contracts. Although I have actually been gaining a lot of confidence in solidity simply by understanding guilds and the governance contracts, actually writing changes was a good way of putting it into practice and hopefully I can do some more changes to come.\n\n**Did ok:\n**\n\nDXvote maintenance - We have kept up with fairly regular updates and releases to DXvote despite it not being the main focus of most of the team whilst guilds have been in development. There have still been a few bugs and issues occurring but I think they have been relatively well dealt with all things considered. However, I am looking forward to having guilds shipped and being able to allocate more resources to DXvote 1.1.\n\n**Could have done better:\n**\n\nI’m sad we weren’t able to do much to be able to help Lulli stay contributing to DXgov as he is an amazing developer but hopefully he will be able to return in a few months.\nWallet schemes - The ongoing saga of getting wallet schemes working on xdai has been a somewhat tiring one with a good few bumps along the way. Due to the timing of the interim audit report, we have decided to further postpone the use of the new architecture on gnosis chain since it will need redeployment once issues have been addressed. Not without benefit though, this experience has raised a lot of problems with our development process that we will soon be fixing.\n\n**Payment\n**\n\nI took a week off towards the end of this period although I worked 2 half days and am taking my 1 holiday a month also so counting that as 85% (3 days/15% off) of the second payment.\n\nI’ll also be requesting my Denver stipend in this proposal also\n\n$6800 + EthDenver($1500+$800+$200) = $9300\n\n7 DXD vested for 3 years and 1 year cliff\n\n1933 REP + 3090 REP (Last proposal I synced to mainnet finally and so this proposal gets me back up to mainnet's correct REP as well as this period REP)","title":"Ross Neilson Worker Proposal 18/12/2021-18/2/2022 End","hash":"QmZo5Y2gr63GHooet1X49UULChuaZ3wBWeRJZiaUtXYQpJ"},"0x227337083229771dd0abf9a579d076cc9536180569a15f1bf6971c6243bb4bce":{"description":"This proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

I’ve already finished my trial period during December and I’m currently working on DXGov projects.\n\nA little about me.

As per my worker proposal I will be requesting the second payout here.\n\nUnfortunately, web dev human resources became scarce in Omen, and other teams, which makes it very difficult, quite impossible, to mentor a junior developer as I am. And so I won’t be continuing contributing. Though, I learned a ton and I am immensely grateful for the opportunity DXdao handed me 3 months ago. I will tell everyone goodbye during today’s gov call.\n\nAs I started with Omen, a couple of weeks before my contribution period initiated, digging inside the codebase and coding tiny tasks I felt confident I could overcome the challenge Omen development represented. But starting a web dev career within a dao, where the environment pushes you to be as independent as possible, rapidly turned out wrong for me and for my ‘negative’ spillovers, or at least recurrent cumbersome questions, to the team. After fighting with git, learning deeper react, styled components, understanding the latest way of writing js code, the way Omen code is pushed, collaborated on, I still managed to contribute at my modest, beginner level.\n\nMassive kudos to @Violet which, despite having loads on his plate, took the time to answer my beginners questions and review all my PRs. Thank you @geronimo and @Melanie for giving me the opportunity to be part of the team and assist me.\n\nI still feel very lucky because within 3months of experience at DXdao I managed to meet most of you in Paris while many of you never had that chance in years. I am blessed I took part in it, and this is probably not a farewell since I’m sure we’ll cross path again. DXdao has great talents, powerful ideas and a super product suite. I wish you to deliver great management and make the best out of it.\n\nWork done\n\nThe main objectives I worked on were the refactoring of styles and some OMN airdrop front-end feature.\nHere are all my PRs.

It concludes that 1) general partnership risks are less of a concern for DXdao compared to other US DAOs due to its lack of critical mass in one single US state and the risks can be further mitigated by DXdao’s global decentralization strategy and governance agreement regarding dispute settlements; 2) the risk of token offerings being viewed as security is low as the tokens are most likely to be viewed as utility tokens; 3) DXdao will be further exposed to US taxation risks once its product/services become more profitable given its close link with the US key contributors.\n\nIn view of the type and magnitude of risks at hand, it proposes two sets of actionable recommendations depending on the resources and priorities of DXdao:\n\nMinimal steps:\nDXlegal shall implement continuous risk monitoring and assessment with contributor squad & governance and treasury, especially in the following areas:\nContributor residence\nproduct/business map: identify which products/squads are most at US legal/taxation risks\nTreasury: pay particular attention to activities that can be tied to the US.\nLong-term talent strategy and governance:\ni.

Under the static/current law approach, it requires a multi-pronged approach that combines decentralized jurisdictions with decentralized entities/ purpose/products. Under the progressive approach, where law is a viewed as a construct and evolves to adapt the needs of society, DAOs can be recognized under the private international law, which will be aligned with DXdao’s ultimate vision as self-sovereign.\n\n3.I’ve also presented my findings at the Business Strategy call, you can find the presentation deck here:\nhttps://www.notion.so/Presentation-on-DXdao-s-US-Legal-Challenges-and-Global-Decentralization-Strategy-bc90b5810d4546dd81656a779e1d5fac 2\n\nPlease don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or want to discuss further.

Which also makes it easily available on platforms such as Curve, Uniswap etc.\n\nStakewise uses a dual token model, with a separate token for the staked eth and the reward eth. This, eventually allows restaking the reward tokens. See more: [https://docs.stakewise.io/tokens](https://docs.stakewise.io/tokens)\n\nWhile just recently released, RocketPool is a very promising staking option as it aims to be fully decentralized. While the protocol is very “new” on mainnet, it has gone through extensive testing on testnets and has been audited by top-tier auditors. Allocating some ETH to RocketPool would also signal DXdao’s support for decentralized products.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying an initial amount of ETH, distributed between the three liquid staking options mentioned, with the following breakdown:\n\n\n\n* 500 ETH on Lido for stETH\n* 300 ETH on Stakewise for sETH2\n* 200 ETH on RocketPool for rETH\n\nFor the purposes of staking the ETH, the DAO will rely upon the Multi-Sig `0x5F239a6671BC6d2bAEf6D7Cd892296e678810882`, which has already handled all treasury diversification proposals as well as bridging funds to different bases. Once the given tokens are acquired the MS shall return those funds to the mainnet DXdao treasury.\n\nThis proposal also authorizes the MS to handle up to 500ETH in one transaction for the purpose of staking it.\n\n**Acquiring the staked assets**\n\nDue to limitations on the tech-side and with an interest to move forward in the near future, if the proposal passes, the most pragmatic solution is to make use of the dev multi-sig.\n\nBelow are a set of ways we could acquire the assets, by either trading ETH for them or minting new tokens.\n\nstETH:\n\n\n\n* Available on Curve ETH/stETH\n* Has Gnosis Safe integration\n\nsETH2:\n\n\n\n* Has Gnosis Safe integration\n\nrETH:\n\n\n\n* Wallet Connect / Gnosis Safe\n\n**More info**\n\n[https://docs.lido.fi/](https://docs.lido.fi/)\n\n[https://docs.stakewise.io/](https://docs.stakewise.io/)\n\n[https://docs.rocketpool.net/](https://docs.rocketpool.net/)\n\n**Details**\n\nThis proposal sends 500 ETH to the ETHrelayer contract, identified as, `0xb9C11a239CEb03626b439dDeD95AC51ffe000795`, which will relay the ETH to the dev multi-sig address, previously identified as `0x5f239a6671bc6d2baef6d7cd892296e678810882` whose signatories have been verified as REP holders. The MS will stake the ETH and return the staked ETH tokens back to the DXdao treasury.\n\n**Risks**\n\nTransfer of these funds relies on the [Dev multi-sig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f239a6671bc6d2baef6d7cd892296e678810882).

This is the second of (2) multi-call proposals and relies on (2) prior funding proposals**\n\n## Background\n\nContinuing the implementation of the Approved New DXD Token Model, this post is a proposal to deploy additional WETH/DXD liquidity on Swapr on GnosisChain, totalling approximately (1)5 WETH and 35.565 DXD.\n\nOne of the implementation provisions of the New DXD token model was to use DXdao treasury assets to increase DXD liquidity. It committed up to $1m of DXD/ETH. The proposal authorizes liquidity to be provisioned once the DXD Treasury NAV ratio surpasses 60%. The latest calculation is 68%.\n\nSo far, 130 ETH and 300 DXD have been allocated on mainnet and sent to the DXSwap relayer to be deployed, of which approximately 57.7 ETH and 152 DXD have been deployed. The remaining allocation on mainnet will be deployed separately from this proposal, with the total adding up to approximately $400,000 in liquidity (depending on price).\n\nThe Swapr DXD/WETH liquidity pool on GnosisChain is currently pretty thin, with only ~11.5 ETH and ~27 DXD, totaling roughly $34,000 in liquidity. Over half the liquidity was recently removed. Given the strategic importance of GnosisChain to the DAO, we believe that the treasury should add liquidity to this pool to improve the ability of DAO participants and others to more effectively interact with it.\n\n15 WETH is a little less than half of the available WETH on the GnosisChain treasury\n\n## Details/Implementation\n\nWe propose depositing 15 WETH and 35.565 DXD liquidity over 4 transactions to the Swapr WETH/DXD liquidity pool on Gnosis Chain.\n\n- Proposal 1 would send 15 WETH from the DXD GnosisChain treasury to the DXSwap relayer.\n- Proposal 2 would send 36 DXD from the DXD GnosisChain treasury to the DXSwap relayer.\n\nThose 2 transactions would be proposed concurrently using the Funding and Voting Power Scheme and upon passing would be followed up with 2 multi-call proposals, separated a day apart. We are proposing 2 transactions due to the low liquidity in the pool to prevent manipulation.\n\n- Proposal 3 would add 6 ETH and 14.4 DXD in liquidity to the pool.\n- Proposal 4 would add 9 ETH and 21.6 DXD in liquidity to the pool.\n\nAll liquidity addition transactions would have a 5% slippage tolerance, but due to fluctuating prices, less of 1 asset may get added to the pool. Remaining assets in the DXSwap relayer can be removed back into the DXdao treasury via an optional 5th proposal.\n\nOnce completed, these transactions will be added to the running total of DAO owned liquidity and tracked as the DAO continues to execute on the New Token Model.\n\n## Notes, Risks, and Considerations\n\n- Note on Treasury NAV: This liquidity provision was approved as part of the new DXD Token Model, but there was not specifics on how it affects Treasury NAV. Many projects do not include protocol-owned liquidity as part of treasury calculation, but for clarification, the ETH in the DXD/ETH LP position counts toward Treasury NAV, but the DXD in it does not count towards circulating supply\n- Impermanent loss is a risk for all 50/50 constant-product automated market makers. That should be limited here because of the higher fee as well as the price range that DXD/ETH should trade in. Using the Swapr Liquidity Relayer comes with its own set of risks as it relates to oracle manipulation. Breaking the deposit amounts down into smaller increments makes it more expensive to manipulate.\n- Lastly, Due to how Automated Market Makers work, new DXD will enter the circulating supply should the price of DXD/ETH go above what the pool was deposited at. This issuance would be offset by more ETH “owned by the treasury” and thus shouldn’t have a large effect on NAV calculations, but DXdao should be mindful of this.","title":"ETH/DXD Liquidity - Deposit 9 WETH and 21.6 DXD (2/2)","hash":"Qmcj5pn9dKk38TeUnkTPwfLwMsvKAKX5xXCAXEZ55BYXcc"},"0x289758c6df9d0cd1191174c0df246c73c6fdfa0b16dea97585c50f486758cfbd":{"description":"In accordance with [this proposal from mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x26605ac44027de3d2e03f3168040ce45ed9706970fef0fec2ad8db0e870bdbba), this proposal will order a liquidity deposit in Swapr for 29.263 WETH, sent to the relayer by [this xDXdao proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x84e1b3020d7e2484352c6f23469d0b988aac392fc096dffefc1cbc6d6855e4bb) and [this xDXdao proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xce3eb45ad8890c4445ffecbf987123fe47ece79753991a5bc6e7fe7252174bf2), and 128.64 DPI sent by [this xDXdao proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xd402265faa5330608f503e2fe22a7b96d866f07771ca5fd37ec7f0a46c1cef55).","title":"Provide liquidity on Swapr WETH/DPI pair via Swapr Relayer I","hash":"QmRGthGRsF9Yn7MLTwPUnKtv99UVNKbuSK4jvXkB53HaRS"},"0x291fa8fdb91b5709af7120f591addc589fe4fbc578e6cc27a23bf9b7fe578113":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

The community initiated the program to return value to DXD holders given the growth in the treasury. So far, DXdao has purchased 2,992 DXD through the program at an average price of 0.135 ETH/DXD or $875k with 4 additional orders as live proposals currently. \n\nThis has been executed through the [GP Relayer](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmd8TCEr6syKxAnmuBH3hsyvxfSgRJgANLTTorp3JGZY77) on xDai and mainnet, which places an order on the Gnosis Protocol using the Swapr ETH/DXD as an oracle. Each order requires two proposals, a funding one to send ETH to the GP Relayer and a multi-call. 16 orders were executed on xDai and 14 on mainnet. See[ this spreadsheet ](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmebt1o5rq7gzWs3UzBuAY9uk5tjqyRw6BXccVHbdDYsFu)for more information.\n\nThe Buyback Program was [updated in June](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xd6c4bfd03d87c365432c073ff0f36578c3cba9da080b75de5058357319908039) to increase the slippage tolerance to up to 5% and clarify the collar calculation.\n\n**Details**\n\nThis proposal would authorize another $1m in DXD purchases through the process laid out in the original [signal proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45). Buyback orders may be placed on the open market as long as the book value of the ETH and stablecoins in the[ treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) is larger than DXD’s outstanding circulating supply.\n\nAll other parameters established in the original DXD Buyback Program signal proposal and the subsequent [Parameters #1 Update](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xd6c4bfd03d87c365432c073ff0f36578c3cba9da080b75de5058357319908039) will continue to govern the additional $1m in purchases. The community will continue to explore additional avenues for making purchases outside the GP Protocol, including Swapr.\n\nThe community is exploring a new DXD token model and specifically what to do with the [2,499 ETH in the buyback reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a), which is considered to be owned by DXD holders.

This is still a WIP and a lot could change from what is in the stickies here right now.\n\nWe will also have a seperate discussion with the devs to figure out the refactoring scope for the dapp. The feedback from the devs is that we should probably address this sooner to make way for faster product development in the future.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/07XrNne.jpg)\n\n\n**DxStats:**\nWe also made a DxStats [release 1.5.0 ](https://github.com/SwaprDAO/swapr-info/releases/tag/v1.5.0)that included multichain dashboard, improved performance and a better typography.\nFor the next release, we will also be working on new stats that will go into the dashboard page, more bug fixes and performance improvements.\nWe are also getting help from Boris (UX designer) to do a small redesign to make it look in alignment with Swapr design.\n\n**For the month of June:**\nA good goal for the month of June would be to facilitate and finalise the Q3 roadmap for product development, contracts and refactoring, release of Beta 13.\n\n**Compensation:**\nFor the month of May, I would like to be compensated 7459 WXDAI as I had taken 1.5 days off due to travelling and vacation.

It was a busy period for the ContributorX, this is what went well, was just okay, and needs improvement.\n\n**What went well**\n\nWe completed our second contributor feedback review during this period. Providing consistent and constructive feedback is essential when working within a DAO and has always been a challenge for us. I am excited to say that we are starting to make progress on tackling this challenge through the implementation of our own contributor review process. During this recent contributor review, we found that contributors finished this review with ease and more thoroughly than the first. We implemented a few changes that would add great value to the review like the addition of the self-evaluation. At the moment, I can’t say that our feedback review system is perfect, but we are constantly working to improve this process to help ensure our contributors are getting the appropriate feedback they need to succeed within DXdao. Big thank you to @allyq for taking the lead on developing and distributing the content for this review :slight_smile:\n\nAnother initiative completed during this period was Epoch 2 of AppreciationDAO using Coordinape. As expected, we had complete participation from our DXdao contributors and it was a great way for our core contributors to show our appreciation for one another. It is also always good to use new and innovative DAO tools to reward and incentivize our contributors. We hope to continue the use of Coordinape in the upcoming years.\n\nAlso, ETHCC was this period! Meeting contributors face-to-face is always beneficial. We attended many side events and even had our own with Gnosis Chain, GitPOAP and SAFE - DAOs and Builders à Paris. And of course, I’ll save the best last, participating and engaging with web3 enthusiasts in Paris for our Swapr awareness campaign! Looking forward to planning and seeing everyone in October for the Infinite Hackathon, Devcon and DXretreat!\n\n**What was just okay\n**\n\nWe made progress on finding the next DAO Counsel at DXdao. However, we have not identified one contributor who will be our next DAO Counsel yet. This process has been lengthy but we want to ensure we onboard the best candidate/s possible. Currently, there are three candidates completing a DXLegal assignment which can be found here. With the support of @Powers and @dlabs I believe we will have the next DAO Counsel on board by next period.\n\n**Could have been better**\n\nAt the beginning of this period, I worked alongside @ross to try and recruit a new Senior Web3 Developer 1for the Gov squad. Unfortunately, after screening hundreds of candidates and interviewing many we were not able to successfully onboard one. Multiple reasons could be attributed to the lack of finding a candidate, whether it was the market turn, timing, summer season, etc. We were not able to onboard a candidate but many lessons were learned during this interview and screening process.\n\n**Compensation :**\n\n$8,000 (xDAI)\n\n$6,000 (DXD).

It was a long process, and it definitely surfaced a lot of the challenges of recruiting for a DAO. More details around this process can be found here . In conclusion, @nissa was recruited and is now contributing to DXvoice at DXdao.\n\nWhat I did okay\n\nAfter a few months of discussion I finished the development and implementation of DXReferral . I gave myself an “okay” for this because I could have been more timely with this initiative. Despite the timeline, I am overall satisfied with the parameters/guidelines for DXReferral and am happy we now have a referral program for our contributors. The onchain proposal for DXReferral can be found here .\n\nWhat I need to improve on\n\nOver these past few months DXdao lost a few key contributors on our technical team.

This added a lot of value to the DXdao treasury and put DXdao in a position to help influence ENS.\n\nAlso, while we know now it didn’t really work out in the end, there was excitement about AugurDAO and the alignment they saw with DXdao. I feel like DXgov started to come into its own and development of guilds got a boost. I was happy to play a role in facilitating this, though @AugustoL and @ross did the harder work on the product side.\n\nI think it was also a good work period for community engagement. Besides the ENS grant and Augur DAO announcement, I was on three podcasts, and really cool how we ended up finding Wayne through one of them.\n\nAnd it was a great period for building auditing relationships. I think this is where we got back on track and even in a better position than we have been with our previous auditor.\n\n**What I think needs improvement**\n\nI think I could have done more to do a better job onboarding with SpaceInch devs.\n\nThe Agave campaign launch could have had better communication between teams for which I take some of the responsibility.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nLevel K has already received the max amount of REP. According to the guidelines for a DXdao worker with expert level experience and a commitment level of 5, total compensation is 0.875 * $16000 = $14000 in stablecoins or ETH and 0.875 * $12000 = $10500 worth of DXD.  With a 6% deduction this comes out to $13160 and $9870 worth of DXD.\n\n","title":" Level K Worker Proposal and Payout 11/2021 - 12/2021 - LATE SUBMISSION","hash":"QmUEVuF62QmtsPGoXHLxswrD2UPUfmT2qKSYwMmc1XgvW7"},"0x2ff8de4cea61b5aace1fdcaea0b95a69584fa4988bac9a8d2da9b3bce91518cd":{"description":"**Background:**\n  * I have been working at Swapr, where I made UI and code improvements.\n  * Here is a list of my previous PRs:\n    * [swapr-dapp](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aberteotti+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Amerged+)\n    * [swapr-info](https://github.com/dxgraphs/swapr-subgraph/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+author%3Aberteotti+sort%3Aupdated-desc+)\n\n**Timeframe:**\n  * 2 months at 60% full-time (from previous 50%)\n\n**Proposed Scope of Contribution:**\n  * Goals:\n    * Work on the current roadmap for Swapr beta releases.\n    * Add simple chart.\n    * Add advanced trading view.\n    * Add wallet dashboard.\n    * Work on additional features and code improvements for Swapr.\n  * Responsibilities:\n    * Collaborate with Swapr team members to improve the application.\n    * Do code reviews.\n    * Attend development and Swapr meetings.\n\n**Compensation:**\n  * Experience Level: 4\n  * Time commitment: Part-time 24 hours / week (60% full-time) at full rate\n  * Salary for 2 months of work:\n    * Month 1\n      * DAI: $3600 ($6000 * 60%)\n      * DXD: $2400 ($4000 * 60%), vested for 3 years with a 1 year cliff starting the 05 August 2022\n      * REP: 0.1 (0.1667 * 60%)\n    * Month 2\n      * DAI: $3600 ($6000 * 60%)\n      * DXD: $2400 ($4000 * 60%), vested for 3 years with a 1 year cliff starting the 05 August 2022\n      * REP: 0.1 (0.1667 * 60%)\n\n**Previous Proposals:**\n  * [Contributor Proposal & Retrospective [13 June 2022 - 05 August 2022]](https://daotalk.org/t/leonardo-berteotti-contributor-proposal-retrospective-13-june-2022-05-august-2022/4295)\n  * [Contributor Proposal 02/02/2022-18/02/2022](https://daotalk.org/t/leonardo-berteotti-contributor-proposal-02-02-2022-18-02-2022/3957)\n  * [Contributor Proposal 21/02/2022-15/04/2022](https://daotalk.org/t/leonardo-berteotti-contributor-proposal-21-02-2022-15-04-2022/4005)\n    * [Self Reflection 21/02/2022-15/04/2022](https://daotalk.org/t/leonardo-berteotti-contributor-proposal-21-02-2022-15-04-2022/4005/3)\n  * [Contributor Proposal 18/04/2022 - 10/06/2022](https://daotalk.org/t/leonardo-berteotti-contributor-proposal-18-04-2022-10-06-2022/4154)\n\nFull REP will be asked on proposal end.","title":"Leonardo Berteotti Contributor Proposal [08 August 2022 - 30 September 2022]","hash":"QmdpK7iJoXBgaYsBqh1oKmD2FzYnCzUXnMKgPbiRBKyuU9"},"0x3031f3a003998c291e61a860863e58699c42c0d3bd1f9d50fd6b231fc024bdbe":{"description":"Flight $500\n\nHotel $800\n\nDaily Stipend $300","title":"Jorge Lopes Paris Stipend","hash":"QmYaNrNaLvQ9idBsDHXnPcdeEvq4uW1X7jojKV8F2WW9NZ"},"0x30691498524c66efd6ead5e9b039ca2ddbf30ec4b7a9db24cc7520a594184236":{"description":"As per the original worker proposal's terms (visible [here](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x20a4cde9a71e767526dd73ae67d108dbdd5b39b023e8ad9c85a03add31d5cc1d)), I'm asking for 8k xDai.

On the frontend:\n\n- Make WalletConnect support both mainnet AND xDai. If the user switches network to xDai or mainnet through the network switcher, and then connects with WalletConnect, the last picked network will be used for the WalletConnect connection request, whether that is xDai or mainnet (Arbitrum not supported yet).\n\n- Minor layout fixes around the swap box and the eco routing dropdown.\n\n- Fix on pagination, displaying page links on multiple rows. Replaced old pagination style with new, user-typing based style, which looks far better on high number of pages (for example on \"pairs and rewards\" page on xDai).\n\n- Reset pagination when applying \"with rewards\" filter. The page is now set to 0 to allow actual data showing up.\n\n- Fix \"blank page\" bug when user visits expired liquidity mining campaign pages. The APY is now returned as 0 as soon as the campaign ends.\n\n- Fix multi chain links. Pages can now be linked on the correct chain. If the user landing on the page is connected to a different chain, he's asked to switch it to the correct one before being allowed to continue.\n\n- Made Swapr compatible with Arbitrum One/Arbitrum Rinkeby testnet. This includes subgraph changes and frontend/SDK changes, to finally make Swapr usable on those networks.\n\nThe proof for the above claims can be seen by consulting my commits on the develop branch, which can be done by clicking [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/commits/develop?after=3ffb8b5912876238e7c96d2c46a52c768b313ea4+104&author=luzzif&branch=develop).\n\nI've also developed a serverless API deployed on AWS for Coingecko to fetch liquidity mining (farming) data to be displayed on Coingecko itself. The work can be seen [here](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-coingecko-farming), and Coingecko is already using the service.\n\nOn the token side instead, I have:\n\n- Written the airdrop whitelist generation script, which specifically for the DXD side now supports pure holders, Swapr LPs on both mainnet and xDai, Balancer v1 LPs on mainnet, Uniswap v2/v3 LPs on mainnet, Honeyswap LPs on xDai and mainnet, Loopring holders and Mesa LPs on xDai and mainnet. The marketing airdrop also includes everything that was agreed upon by the squad.\n\n- Added a recover function to the airdrop claimer contract. After a certain cutoff date is reached, the owner can reover any non-claimed airdrop tokens.\n\nThe work can be checked out [here](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-token-contracts/commits/master).","title":"DAI payout (26/06/2021-26/07/2021) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmTzFmbYKqQAouHnezhiW9zcTLm52aoekdgcpJiaQPcfuz"},"0x306a8623c1f0a2ba3d9cf5659628bc6bc68a11c85db60f50424219db6e5fead3":{"description":"This signal proposal aims to reach consensus on the Q2 REP Boost proposal, found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-discord-rep-boosts-q2-2021/3084).

Feedback is appreciated surrounding the structure, updated REP percentages and increase of roles.\n\n> With the introduction of the DXdao Discord server, @KeenanLuke has proposed an initiative to get more community members involved in Governance. A governance gateway drug, if you will. This functions as a quarterly allocation; a way for us to leave the door open to those most active in the community to further involvement with DXdao and its governance. The last Q1 Discord REP Boost was overall a success, with 8 out of a possible 35 community members accepting their invitation, resulting in a total of 4022.65 REP (0.254% REP) being distributed to the community.\n\n> In its current configuration, the DXdao Discord server tracks a user’s participation in the preceding quarter and assigns a role based on quantity and quality of the engagement.\n\n> ## Eligibility\nThe below list contains all users eligible for a boost, their respective level, and the allocation of mainnet REP they are entitled to receive. Active DXdao contributors are not eligible for this initiative, and have been removed from the list. Anyone nominated for a traditional community REP boost is still eligible for this initiative, since high levels are difficult to obtain and the REP is distributed quarterly instead of monthly.\n\n> Although the entitlement is in mainnet REP, it is highly advised that community members request their REP via xDXdao - where governance contract interaction is a fraction of a penny. Anyone is welcome to reach out to @KeenanLuke requesting a small amount of xDai to make their REP request proposal and start voting!\n\n> If no concerns have arisen within 2 days of this post being live, @KeenanLuke will create an updated signal proposal on xDai for this initiative. If the proposal passes, @KeenanLuke will notify those who are eligible and assist in the claiming process by updating the “DXdao Discord REP Boost Guide”. A dedicated channel for the Discord REP boosts will be opened in the Governance category of the DXdao Discord, where eligible participants will be notified.\n\nA \"FOR\" vote indicates support of this program and would welcome the listed community members to request the REP amount shown on the post. \n\nAn \"AGAINST\" vote indicates opposition to this program and that it needs revision or cancellation.","title":"DXdao Discord Q2 REP Boost Signal Proposal","hash":"QmVEW65Uv6JpcWq6yQ4hZMCDb2dWXFkQDm4MGzZWHxPcMn"},"0x3077bc5f17ad534993c84a9b1547955aa09f314057b55a0cba2b377a49d5577d":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

It was also nice receiving some good feedback on the format we handed it back to them in - [read here](https://rossneilson.notion.site/Sigma-Prime-Guilds-Audit-Fixes-145724bb627c4eab94cf285552f2c128). Obviously, this directly blocks the release of guilds since we don't have the report back yet.\n* **DXD guild -** Although the [post](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-voting-power-guilds-2-0/4467) only went up recently a lot of time was put into the article to bring the idea of a DXD guild to DXD holders. I’m hopeful this will provide a meaningful way for DXD holders to voice and enact their opinions in an autonomous way.\n* **Documentation/Planning -** Still really just a start but I ended up using [DXgov’s notion](https://rossneilson.notion.site/DXgov-c1655a56255b4ad78d05162c634b0634) a lot more this period with a total of 12 new posts covering documentation and planning. I still dont think many people read this but it is at least for me a better way of getting ideas onto paper and collecting them into one place. I did also advertise a few in general chats to get thoughts. In particular, I was very happy with some of the planning I got onto paper around [DAVI revenue](https://rossneilson.notion.site/Governance-Revenue-generation-a806c15aca364fd8a4fb2cf61ca75ba4)\n* **Budget -** I took quite a good amount of time looking at DXgov’s budget and I think the work done should help much better give an idea of where DXdao is investing resources. Coming out relatively small in comparison was nice to see and I think we are managing to do some pretty great work considering our budget. The forward-looking budget was made trying to be realistic but also limiting expansion due to market conditions.\n* **QA -** QA’s role in DXgov is growing and I cant really take much credit as it has been Phillip and Milan putting in the work but it is great to see the processes grow and I am sure having QA will greatly increase the quality of DAVI.\n* **DXgov team -** Although this isn't pointing to anything directly nor is it even something I can take all or anything near all the credit for, the team has been working SUPER well recently. We have been crushing each sprint, increasing story points completed, improving processes, devs working on smart contracts and getting very close to being able to show you all our hard work.\n* **Took a holiday! -** I think I have done a pretty good job handling work life balance and taking breaks recently and have been really happy with the results. I find myself more efficient with my time and very far from burnout.\n\n**Did ok:**\n\n* **DAVI’s place in DXgov and DXdao -** I think I am now at the point where I have a solid understanding of what DAVI is and what it can be. But the reason this is just ok is that everyone needs to understand this and right now I think everything DXgov is working on is still pretty confusing. I hope to fix this once we get branding of DAVI sorted, can put out more articles and get the app into people’s hands.\n\n* **Partnerships -** We got a connection to a couple of more teams interested in what we are building so continuing to build out those relationships and future integrations. In addition, followed up with some previous connections. Having DAVI live should help with demos and actually getting people on board.\n* **IPFS solutions -** I developed a small tool (https://github.com/DXgovernance/ipfs-cluster-propagator) for us to propagate our own IPFS data across DAO contributors. As an initial proof of concept, I think it is pretty awesome and a good way for us to utilise decentralised hardware to benefit the DAO. But it needs more people to use it, so still a work in progress. As a side note with the help of Federico and Madusha we have come up with a super awesome concept for a v2 :eyes:\n* **DXdao 1.5 -** We are making big progress towards the contracts being ready for a new parallel DXdao deployment but I didn’t get to spend as much time as I wanted planning out how we are going to handle things on the DAVI side. With how timelines are now I think it is likely we will go with a simple subgraph and tackle the backup cache architecture later.\n\n**Could have done better:**\n\n* **Writing -** I had a bunch of help on the DXD guild article and I am so grateful for that. But I also really want to work more on my own writing style and improve on how I go about polishing the pieces. I think I tend to write in a very personal style and I dont think it works for more structured pieces like this.\n\n**Salary**\n\nCompensation: Level 6\n\nThe last two proposals I made I did not transfer any stablecoins with because I was waiting for DevX AG to be approved [on chain](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/mainnet/proposal/0xbb4921904e4d7d787b61be32ef798ca3365a3d74fcef471ee8d4450352d6f333)\n\nBecause I cannot send payments to one address and rep to another using the ContributionReward scheme I will request REP only on my worker proposals and then create another proposal dealing with stablecoins being sent to the DevX AG address.\n\n2nd month:\n\n$8000 DAI\n\n$6000 DXD\n\n0.1667% REP","title":"Ross Neilson Worker Proposal 18/6/2022-18/8/2022 2/2","hash":"QmNXfNhPMLeRkcXihsfqbPR71gQr8PvEPDnHMeYcKZiGkw"},"0x309f42abf2f360a030b7e51d2d180f1be082dd83c80c9f2ea2cf9a9e7624f1c8":{"description":"This proposal sends 10.74 WETH to the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions) intended to be used to place an order to purchase xDXD in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was originally passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45), and extended through a further proposal which also passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x6f4bb1bb12469639b4af6f67ee04b174b07df211b3de45e6254de65082446af0) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x29842379fd0990415138b61b760e296059423fc35b3314f939573a4dd0aecbb3).

The extension on the buyback program was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/extend-dxd-buyback-program-for-another-1m-draft-proposal/3319). \n\nThis proposal would place a limit order on the Gnosis Protocol at a price that is 3% above the time-weighted average price of xDXD/WETH on Swapr when the proposal is executed and the [Oracle contract is called](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xFbAc9467FCcb14394860A9E280E2FBabCBbc8DD2/transactions).

Because of that we’ve had some pushbacks, indecisiveness and ambiguity about my role; people were questioning my expertise as the plan was to onboard me to the front-end lead position on Swapr.\n\nAt the end, on of the calls dxDAO decided that I should be initially onboarded to Nimi to get a chance to prove myself, show my skills, get proper technical evaluation and during that two weeks period (pre-trial) dxDAO (squad leaders) will try to find the best fit for me and later allocate me on one of dxDAO’s projects to the role appropriate to my leadership / technical skills.\n\n## **Proposal #1 - \"Pre-Trial (50/50)\"**: *09th September, 2022 - 22nd September, 2022*\n\n#### Proposed Scope of Contribution\n\nI got three tasks which were UI / animation heavy because I have claimed that I have experience with the animations:\n- Task #1: Create Configure POAPs Modal with all necessary sub-components add animations\n- Task #2: Refactor form inputs and introduce proper reordering functionality\n- Task #3: Update Nimi data models according to the updates and future features.\n\n#### Work\n\nHere are my pull requests to Nimi’s Card and App repositories for that period:\n- Feature/140 - POAPs Editor - https://github.com/nimi-app/card/pull/83\n- Feature/140 - POAPs Editor - https://github.com/nimi-app/app/pull/150\n- Nimi Form Update v2.1 - https://github.com/nimi-app/app/pull/154\n\n#### Follow-Up\n\nAfter my pre-trial period, I was informed that I finished it successfully in the timeframe that was given to me and that I pleased “squad leaders”. It was decided on the developer’s planning call where my work was presented and evaluated and dxDAO decided that I should move on and continue the collaboration. As dxDAO still wasn’t clear about the needs of the projects and where I should be onboarded, I was informed that I should stay and work on Nimi until I’m informed differently.\n\n## **Proposal #2 - \"Trial (80%)\"**: *23rd September, 2022 - 22nd November, 2022*\n\nFor the current, ongoing period of two months it is decided that I will work on `Swapr` and `Nimi`.\n\n### **Nimi**\n\nPrior to Devcon, Nimi team decided to introduce templating / theming features to the application and that required many changes. It was of great importance to finish that as soon as possible because it was supposed to be ready for the Devcon. As I have experience with those things, and I was already familiar with the project and the team, I started working on it. Since Devcon was approaching, we were working over an hour to complete everything on time. During that time, I was invited to come to Bogota because it would be a great opportunity to meet the team and attend the Devcon. I was thinking for some time, I had a call with Violet, Zett and Melanie to clarify the details and decided to come as it would benefit both dxDAO and me to meet each other.\n\n#### Proposed Scope of Contribution\n\nI got my next tasks:\n\n- Update application structure which will support templating / theming\n- Create Nimi at Devcon theme before Devcon\n- Create Nimi at Raave theme\n- Create Nimi at Infinite Hackathon theme\n- Create Nimi at Daivinity theme\n- Refactor Nimi’s Architecture.\n\n#### Work\n\nHere are my pull requests to Nimi’s Card and App repositories for that period:\n\n- Theme Support with Structure Updates - https://github.com/nimi-app/card/pull/92\n- Small Updates - https://github.com/nimi-app/card/pull/98\n- Created Raave Theme - https://github.com/nimi-app/card/pull/101\n- Created Infinite Hackathon Theme - https://github.com/nimi-app/card/pull/102\n- Created Daivinity Theme - https://github.com/nimi-app/card/pull/103\n- Refactoring Nimi’s Architecture - https://github.com/bejzik8/nimi-component\n\n### **Swapr**\n\nAfter my pre-trial period, it was decided that I should be onboarded to Swapr as my main project. Plan was to get familiar with it, introduce myself to the codebase, meet the team, start contributing, to take the front-end leadership position after some time and to give more structure to the project, organize the team in order to increase productivity and work experience, write the documentation, componentize the application, make it more maintainable, etc.\n\nI started by researching what Swapr is doing, I got an introduction to the application by multiple team members. I was reading about the concepts Swapr implements, I was exploring the packages which are used on the project in order to get a thorough understanding of the project. I cloned the project and started to explore the code to see what principles are being used and to understand which approach is taken when writing React. I started attending the calls and got my assignments, too.\n\n#### Proposed Scope of Contribution\n\nI got my tasks, had to update the `Transactions Table` and to give a smooth animation to it. After thorough investigation, I came to the conclusion that there's more to it rather than just a UI update. I saw that we need to update the logic, fetching and Redux, too. I communicated this with the team on our developer calls and I am waiting for my last PR to be merged.\n\n#### Work\n\nHere are my pull requests to Swapr for that period:\n\n- Optimisation of Data Dispatching to Redux in Advanced Trading View - https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pull/1592\n- Optimisation of Data Fetching in Advanced Trading View - https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pull/1597\n- Advanced Trading View's Logic Update - https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pull/1599.\n\n## **Compensation**\n\nConsidering my performance, quality of my output, my expertise in the field and thoroughness I bring, I identify myself as a level 6 contributor but I was advised to submit my first, 80% proposal one level below, so **level 5** it is. As per Contributor Compensation Guidelines, I propose myself getting compensated with:\n\n- **0.3084% REP** *(0.1667% REP x RATE*)*\n- **$12.950 in xDAI** *($7.000 x RATE*)*\n- **$9.250 in DXD** *($5.000 x RATE*)*.\n\n*RATE = .5 * .5 + 2 * .8 = 1.85*\n \n*P.S. I guess some of you might have a questions regarding my proposals and why I didn’t ask to get paid upfront:*\n\n*On my onboarding calls with Augusto and Adam, because of the situation dxDAO was experiencing, the ongoing restructuring and the whole suspicion thing, I said that I don't want to get any money before I finish the job successfully. I also believe that the current payment model should be rethought in order to protect dxDAO’s interests. IMHO, streamed payments is the best solution for this specific thing as it provides the security and is “fair solution” both for dxDAO and the contributors.*\n\n*P.P.S.

The extension on the buyback program was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-program-signal-proposal/2890). This funding proposal and the subsequent trade proposal use an updated version of the GP Relayer than the one referenced in the DXD Buyback Program Signal Proposal in order to add Swapr to the GP Relayer’s exchangeFactoryWhitelist.\n\nThe DXD Buyback Program Signal proposal stipulates that the purchase amount should be based on the DXD Average Daily Trading Volume (ADTV). [According to the most recent on-chain data and estimates](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmU1gB6iJbEgxK2BF9ugmH4LSzmwqSA934jb8Y3aieTwtk), DXD has averaged $134k over the last 3 months, so this proposal sends 8.43 WETH to the GP relayer on xDai, identified as `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`, using a [$3973.95 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum).

This reflection is late as I changed the order of my contributor proposals. I posted my current, active contributor proposal first then followed by the recap. Unfortunately, due to the hecticness around the Colombia trifecta (Infinite, Devcon and DXretreat,) this post came very late afterwards. I will reflect on this when considering the order of the contributor proposal process moving forward. With that being said, here is my retrospective.\n\nWhat went well\n\nWe wrapped up the DXLegal assessments. I feel confident in these contributors to support DXdao with any potential legal needs for the future. A recap and presentations of their assessments can be found on DAOtalk and below:\n\n* DXdao’s Approach to the US \n* AML/KYC Overview \n* DXdao’s Legal Challenges and Global Decentralization Strategy \n\nWe started discussion and made progress around Contributor Guideline updates, the first draft proposals can be found here 1. This updates tackle items specifically around: Late contributor proposals penalties, Contributor proposal process, Trial period and onboarding and Contributor level changes.\n\nI supported the recruitment and onboarding of a new UI/UX designer, @Artistocrat for DAVI. Excited for him to join our current design team.\n\nIn addition, much preparation this period was put in for Infinite, Devcon and DXretreat alongside @augustol, @allyq, @whatt4, @Arhat , @sky , @KeenanL and of course Lateral in the planning of this. Preparation included weekly meetings, collaboration with co organizers and supporting Lateral with internal communications. Big thanks to @Powers and @dlabs for help with payments.\n\nNeeds improvement\n\nThroughout this period things were a bit tumultuous for DXdao. We began the process of our restructure and refocus and we were faced with many internal challenges throughout. Reflecting back on the events of this process I know I could have been more vocal and better supported the facilitation of these difficult conversations and transitions. Communication has been consistently identified as an area of improvement in DXdao and the ContributorX and I will do my best to improve this.

Development, implementation and management of a scalable DAO recruiting and onboarding system.\n\nLegal: The legal squad helps the DXdao community navigate the myriad of jurisdiction and off-chain issues that contributors and stakeholders face.\n\n## Overall Guild Milestones and goals\n\n* Steward DXdao through the new budgetary process and 1st 6-month cycle, including the rollout of Davi and the new guild system.\n* Coordinate on and push forward [phase 3 of Restructuring and Refocus](https://daotalk.org/t/restructuring-and-refocus-an-alternative-proposal/4522/2).\n* Formalize and

Stewards are eligible to earn up to $1500 USD & DXD per budgetary period, but if there are more than 10 who apply and meet all thresholds then the total pool will be evenly split between all eligible stewards. This is a contingency request in this proposal and will be outlined in a separate forum post.\n\n\n## Guild Personnel\n\nIndividual contributor lists, contributor level information per [approved guidelines](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xaa3c6d9953d5510a0f014f946e94f03f07a4e5259718e86f07d41d255917e410), and time commitment as percentage of full time.\n\n|Contributor|Level|Time Commitment|Description of Role|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Caney Fork|Level 8|30 hrs/week|Primary host of weekly governance call, drafts proposals, spreadsheets and helps coordinate amongst major stakeholders in DXdao.

During that time, I automated several tasks using Python and PowerQuery, and wrote documentation, standardized and implemented the Kanban methodology on various business processes.\n\nIn 2021, I decided to switch careers and focus on learning the JavaScript stack during off-work hours and weekends, finally going full-time on learning in December and starting a bootcamp in January 2022.\n\nMy whole life I’ve been tech-oriented. I wrote my first line of code when I was 13 and had been programming on and off since then. When Bitcoin was starting, I remember trying to set up a mining node on an old HP laptop (I don’t know if I succeeded, but who knows, maybe there’s a laptop somewhere worth a couple of bitcoins).\n\nI’m interested in blockchain development to translate current governance processes into a robust decentralized system. My vision for the future is a world where small organizations can easily set up fully decentralized and transparent processes that are also scalable and secure.\n\nI’m currently contributing to the DXvote project on the front-end but want to learn and gather a more profound knowledge of smart contracts and solidity development.\n\nThis is my first contributor proposal and was introduced to DXdao by Augusto.

We have been discussing the use of Coordinape for quite some time, and it finally came to life in the first quarter of 2022.  The process was almost seamless and well adapted by DXdao contributors. I look forward to continuing the use of this DAO tool as one of the many ways to reward our active, valuable contributors.\n\nWith the big support of @violet, @nylon, @zett and @luzzifoss we were able to recruit 8 new contributors to DXdao over the past 2 months. Big thank you! It is great to see our product teams growing to help us reach our goals.  \n\n**What I can improve on:**\n\nAlthough I can say ETHDenver was a success overall, there were still areas of improvement that I have identified for myself. Increased attention to detail and communication should have been given to DXdao contributors for the ETHDenver Buidlathon. This would have prevented a few hiccups during the buidler judging and award distribution phases. Despite this, I think we are in a good rhythm of planning and attending conferences/events with our community. \n\nOnboarding new contributors was a bit challenging during this period.  Two main factors caused this: 1. Number of new contributors onboarding was higher than usual (a good problem to have) and 2. ETHDenver - balancing the coordination of the conference.  Moving forward, I will improve strategy on how many new contributors we can support onboarding at any given time.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\nThis proposal falls under the new compensation structure enacted on 01/01/2022.\n\n- Level 6\n- Time commitment- 100%\n- Contributing to DXdao since 3/22/2021.\n- Full-time for total of 40 hours per week\n\nMonth 2\n- $8,000 (xDAI)\n- $6,000 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n- 0.1667% REP\n- I attended the ETHDenver conference from February 14th-21st.

We've been working alongside the UI designs by Geronimo, and have completed a good chunk of the UI already, even among the holidays.\n\nPersonally, I took a proper vacation after a while and also graduated from university, so the past couple of months have been quite a fun ride.\n\n### Did well:\n- A lot of work to support the guilds MVP. We didn't have anything Guilds-related written at the start of this proposal period, so the current progress is quite good.\n- Improvements, code refactoring and new features to DXvote. Among other things, this included:\n  - Cache handling improvements\n  - CSV and Markdown data exports to DXvote\n\n### Improve on:\n- Some of the DXvote improvements and bugfixes have been slower due to the guilds MVP work. This is something that would probably continue due to the limited resources we have, but we can put more focus on minimizing the impact.\n- I couldn't read up deeper on the Guilds smart contracts due to ongoing work and holidays.\n\n### Work completed:\n- Find my completed pull requests [here](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amprasanjith+is%3Aclosed).\n\n### Compensation:\nBecause my proposal period overlapped with the holiday period, I had reduced availability in December.

Since then, 10,153 DXD have been purchased on mainnet and Gnosis Chain for an [average price of 0.164 ETH/DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing). Using the USD price at the time of purchase, $5.5m of DXD has been purchased. This is just over 20% of the DXD circulating supply.\n\nThe [buyback program was updated ](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153)in June to increase the slippage tolerance of trades as well as clarify the accounting measures. The buyback program has since been extended [five times](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x064e0a90970442a4f7a04163c2afdcd7b65c83d00690ccb49e2af3441baddf5d). The total amount of DXD purchased is approaching the limit placed on it by the previous proposal and soft community consensus has demonstrated support for another $1m extension.\n\nAccounting for the 10,153 DXD purchased and the 461 DXD that has been issued to contributors in vested contracts, the 458 DXD that has been issued to LPs for Swapr farming and the 1985 DXD in unissued DXD compensation, the outstanding DXD supply (42,453 DXD) represents a market cap of $22.9m - still comfortably below the $46m in ETH and stables in the DXdao treasury and the $7.8m in the buyback reserve. The buyback program is intended to address this discrepancy and acquire an undervalued asset.\n\nIn line with the [most recent buyback extension](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0xf9ad08c10220621e2aa15eb6ef177f07acd8e2ff6ef8311a0258dd70335c4136) the mainnet signal proposal is also sending the funds necessary to complete the buyback, and as with the previous transfer, these are being sent directly to the GP relayer on Gnosis Chain. This proposal also sends the ETH needed for this buyback extension to the Multichain multi-sig (via the ETH relayer).\n\nAdditionally, this proposal also enables buyback order volume sizes to account for delays in buyback order submissions. Buyback order submissions can be above the 25% ADTV amount in the event that the previous week saw buyback orders who’s total purchase size was less than 125% of the DXD ADTV. These proposals should make a note of the increased purchase size and should not exceed 60% of ADTV. \n\n### Details\n\nThis proposal extends the DXD Buyback Program for another $1m to $7m total under the same conditions outlined in the original [Buyback Program signal proposal ](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [the parameter update ](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153). It also authorizes additional parameters around purchase size and weekly DXD trade volume.\n\nThis proposal ends 345 ETH to the ETHrelayer contract for the multichain multisig, identified as, 0x3e99bEd13071176fE06b317b33e2dcd1E1c9f2BE , which will relay the ETH to the Multichain multisig address, previously identified as 0x9467dcFD4519287e3878C018c02f5670465a9003 whose signatories have been verified as REP holders, which will convert it to WETH and bridge it over to be deposited into the [GPv1 relayer on Gnosis Chain](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions), 0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46.\n\nThese and other DXD purchases through the Buyback Program have contributed to the community’s intention to use the buyback reserve to purchase DXD. ETH from [DXdao’s general treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) can be used in lieu of the buyback reserve until the DXD token contract is upgraded and that ETH is recovered. In total, the [buyback reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521) has 2,499 ETH and so far, 1669 ETH has been used to purchase 10,153 DXD through the buyback program. \n\nThe community is [discussing the future of the DXD buyback program](https://daotalk.org/t/discussion-on-the-long-term-future-of-the-dxd-buyback-program-the-dxd-token-model/3860) and welcome input.\n\n### Risks and considerations\n\nThe program will take place on Gnosis Chain, a sidechain with less security properties than Ethereum. The Buyback Program has been running for over half a year with few problems; the GP Relayer has worked to complete the purchases at the market price. There is a concern that Gnosis Protocol v1 on Gnosis Chain will have limited support, but DXdao community members are striving to maintain the network of solvers. The community is also exploring additional options\n\nDXdao has already spent over $5.6m repurchasing DXD. This has increased the price of DXD relative to ETH but it still falls below the book value of ETH in the treasury.\n\nFull execution of this proposal relies on the Multichain multi-sig, which has already bridged and transferred millions of dollars of assets to Gnosis Chain.","title":"DXD Buyback Extension #6","hash":"QmT2ppXJyDK6Bymh85oND6SHcSQQGLJ1aGXxWyiaLkxSb7"},"0x386aacb02b1d321097ce579a35992e86a50682d8ac656843425abcb40428d179":{"description":"\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

When the time came to move out of the country I was really nervous about it, too much uncertainty in every step of this task.

Now I moved out of Russia and feel a lot happier, got steady ground and ready for work.

This proposal extends the role as a contributor for a two month period.\n\nI plan to continue to focus a majority of time on the DXbiz Squad revolving around business development opportunities, DXdao awareness and product awareness while contributing minority time to other initiatives as well. I will also focus on driving initiatives forward that I think are important for DXdao, even if they sit outside of my main focus.\n\nI estimate my contribution focus to be 55% DXbiz, 10% DXventures, 10% DXvoice, 10% Governance, 15% Other/ContributorX/Product/Testing/Strategy.\n\nWhat I plan to focus on and be responsible for:\n\n**DXbiz:** I have ongoing responsibilities as the DXbiz Squad leader, which can be seen regularly in past proposals, mainly being the coordination of DXdao’s opportunities while acting as a main internal point of contact for all things related to these opportunities. I also represent DXdao and its ecosystem at Ethereum events and in relationships with other DAOs, funds, projects, and partners. Other related responsibilities include:\n\n* Coordinate the organization of and tracking of DXbiz opportunities. Checking in with points of contact and status for each opportunity\n* Focus on opportunities connecting DXdao and it’s products to other communities\n* Provide knowledge to Squads on the related product landscapes and strategies to take\n* Initiating, building and maintaining relationships and discussions on behalf of DXdao with external parties in the ecosystem\n* Partnerships: Develop, grow and filter partnership opportunities for DXdao\n* Bring new ideas from outside learnings to help DXdao expand its strategies across different areas.\n* Develop, write and publish more articles about the unique and important things DXdao is leading with (creating thought leadership articles)\n* Deliver reports of actions taken and opportunity progress to the DXdao community\n* Deliver the ongoing implementation of the weekly DXbiz Huddle (and channel) where we strategize and prioritize ongoing and future opportunities.\n* Coordinating with the product teams of DXgov, Swapr and Carrot around DXbiz opportunities in order to support the ongoing goals and grow awareness of each.\n\nAs DXdao and its products mature and evolve, we will seek out new, larger opportunities that weren’t possible previously. This will hopefully lead to some significant achievements for DXdao.\n\n**DXventures:** I have ongoing responsibilities as the organizer of DXventures, including filtering, presenting, organizing and driving the opportunities that DXdao has. Completing the tasks to bring the most important opportunities to completion.\n\n**DXvoice:** I am also a core member of the DXvoice squad, where I participate and support many of the initiatives around community, recruiting, marketing, writing articles, DXdao’s [video content](https://www.youtube.com/c/dxdao) (will being working to transition this to @wayne), event, merch, design input, representing DXdao for media opportunities and at events. I aim to expand the experimentation and initiatives that DXvoice is pursuing with new ideas like InitiativeDAO.\n\n**Governance:** Leading by example, I will continue to be a highly active governance participant in DXdao, including on-chain actions (review, staking, voting) and the processes and discussions that allow DXdao to remain secure and effective, proper treasury management, open discussions, and standing up for core values. I aim to bring extra initiative to the governance processes. I also aim to push forward the future of DXdao governance by liaising with the DXgov Squad. One of the key values I can bring is being aware of the needs of DXdao and other DAOs.\n\n**Other/ContributorX/Product/Testing/Strategy:** I include this category to account for all other value I plan to contribute to DXdao as a core contributor. This includes actions towards Contributor Experience, product usage, testing reporting and improvements, strategy around DXdao’s products and initiatives, helping to improve Swapr and its usage, health and awareness. I will also be spending time helping to organize and coordinate the events that DXdao participates in.\n\n**Proposal Summary:**\n\nI am identifying as a Level 8 contributor, and will be applying a 90% of full commitment percentage for May 2022 and June 2022 due to outside commitments, personal matters, travel and conferences.\n\n**Summary of compensation would be:**\n\n* 8,100 USD (18,000 x 90% = 16,200) to be paid when the proposal gets approved and the balance (8,100 xDAI) on 6/30/2022 when the contribution agreement finishes.\n* Approval for: 17,100 USD (19,000 x 90% = 17,100) to be paid in DXD in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff when the work agreement finishes.

I also wrote a [Twitter thread summary](https://twitter.com/powers_chris/status/1547683887429521408) on my personal account that had 2,500 impressions.\n* Launch [DXLegal Assessments](https://daotalk.org/t/dxlegal-assessments/4304), this is an initiative to contract with a few crypto lawyers on specific needs for DXdao. If successful, they may be a lower-cost engagement (with specialties) than a full-time DAO Counsel. Working with Dave and Melanie on this.\n* Moving!

This post lays out a plan for DXdao to become more active in ENS governance. I think it’s in the right direction and “okay” because it took a while.\n* [DXdao Budget 2H2022](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-budget-2h2022/4394) After the DXdao expenses [post](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-expenses-update-june-2022/4285) from Caney Fork’s last worker proposal, squad leads worked on their own individual budgets, which I then consolidated into a [comprehensive line-item 6 month budget](https://dxgov.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma25yTiKpZTv4eZT7oMywtpifsBzKzDJ4yz3V31cXZqXT). This was a great process but not yet complete. Some adjustments incoming along with another reconciliation of expenses. More to come.\n\nWhat I did not do well on:\n\n\n\n* I posted [DXD Buyback and Next Steps July 2022](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-update-and-next-steps-july-2022/4374) to give and update on Buyback program, as well as posted the [DXD Token Working Group](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-token-working-group/4388/10) post last week.

After reviewing my scope of contribution and past work, Martin suggested that it is appropriate at this time to raise my level due to the value of my contributions to Mesa. Moving forward, I will continue and be held responsible for providing contributions to Mesa and the community at this level.\n\n# Background\n\nPlease refer to the [Background section of Contributor Proposal for Q1 2021](https://daotalk.org/t/draft-worker-proposal-adam-azad-q1-2021/2659#background)\n\n# Timeframe and Scope\n\n**Timeframe**\n\nApril 1st to May 31st, 2021\n\n**Proposed Scope of Contribution**\n\n* Goals:\n  * Development of the Mesa ecosystem including products, vision, and tokenomics.\n  * Help onboard new developers for Mesa since I am going part-time starting June 1st.\n  * Work on Mesa SDK (first proposed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vh_CbZAo5vsSRrYYkPVHdpU9vAbPd1pDOCPNhoVzUpk/edit#slide=id.p)).\n* Responsibilities:\n  * Review PRs on [mesa-interface](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface) since I would be more focused on smart contracts and integration. In May, I shall go back to coding on the frontend.\n  * Focus on the subgraph updates with the new release of [Mesa smart contracts](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts/pull/55).\n  * Coordinate the delivery of the MVP with Martin Krung.\n  * Write developer and contribution documents for the Mesa ecosystem. We have 5+ active repos on GitHub.\n  * Integrate the contracts on the front end.\n  * Review and submit general improvements to the contracts.\n\n# Self-Reflection\n\n* Did well\n  * The delivery of Mesa SDK. The multicalls the SDK provides will save many steps in building the Mesa Dashboard.\n  * A better understanding of the Mesa smart contracts. Not just how it works, but to develop on top of the current release. My goal is to think about tokenomics for Mesa.\n  * I am the Mesa Subgraph Jedi now. Been diving in the contracts deep and the graph docs\n  * Provide a better IDE for future potential developers in Mesa through some contributions Martin mentioned in his [Tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/martinkrung/status/1399750827158523905https://twitter.com/martinkrung/status/1399750827158523905) :)\n  * Communication with the Mesa team and the DAO members in general. Fun fact: I was on a date in Amman and got carried out, and didn’t produce much for that day. You know, it’s life and happens. I later communicated this to my squad as code of conduct. Life happens, you know :D\n* Did okay\n  * DevOps and contribution documents are something I wanted to focus on as my last month full-time, knowing that I have to hand over the workload to new developers. The current docs are sufficient but lack great technical details I want to elaborate on over the next coming weeks.\n  * Helping Martin with the sprint management. I am not a certified PM/PO, but I have helped him when I could.\n* Improve on\n  * Fix the silo situation in the squad. This is something we’ve noticed in the squad. It’s a collective effort to be transparent and communicative.\n  * Time estimations and promises to Squad Leader. I am somehow over-optimistic about a delivery, but manage to deliver 80-90% of what I promised to deliver for the given sprint (we use Scrum Kanban via Trello at Mesa). We switched to Zenhub with GitHub integration to give estimates for tasks. It should help us stay focused.\n  * Over-committing to certain technical blocks. We had PRs open for more than 4-6 days sometimes, which means deviation of the sprint target.\n\n## Proof of work on GitHub\n\n* [April](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2021-04-01&to=2021-04-30)\n* [May](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2021-05-01&to=2021-05-31)\n\n# Compensation\n  * Experience Level: 4\n  * Time commitment: Full-time (100%\n  * 14,000 DAI: For 2 months of work at level 4 to be paid in one retroactive payout proposal.\n  * 19.12 DXD: Vested for 2 years with a 1-year cliff starting April 1st, 2021. 9.56 DXD per month.\n  * 5,143.2 REP: For 2 months of work, to be paid in two retroactive payout proposals.\n\n![|624x329](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dJNwl_hI19U_1BUl45tR3K9SPIvmdSH0Wjl4CBsEan5sswWoU0bU9xeOf1FmL172Hj-0Ub9odVLEBQmuoS9i_-PNuqA1YVbOJPxPS0cRdXWbMvKIlgQ_BEfsxS2GyR82UiXfZNGV)\n\n# Work Experience\n\n* Prior DXdao work proposals\n  * [[Draft] Worker Proposal, Adam Azad - Q1 2021](https://daotalk.org/t/draft-worker-proposal-adam-azad-q1-2021/2659/3)\n  * [Trial Worker Proposal - Adam Azad - January 13-27th, 2021](https://daotalk.org/t/trial-worker-proposal-adam-azad-january-13-27th-2021/2829/2)\n  * [Worker Proposal - Adam Azad - February 2021](https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-adam-azad-february-2021/2831/2)\n  * [[Draft] Worker Proposal Payout - Adam Azad - March 2021](https://daotalk.org/t/draft-worker-proposal-payout-adam-azad-march-2021/2948/2)\n* Past Work for DXdao\n  * [January contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2021-01-01&to=2021-01-31)\n  * [February contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2021-02-01&to=2021-02-28)\n  * [March contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2021-03-01&to=2021-03-31)","title":"Adam Azad - Contributor Payout Proposal - April 1st - May 31st 2021","hash":"QmUNn7Am5FFGeaeMvt2P4P7Z17eRNcskkrQs9cvdVf2K27"},"0x3be6df4cba0a8e5b7f959fb552fbee596b53305f81339687a12c37eefc2fa62c":{"description":"ignore me","title":"Just testing!","hash":"QmYNwApUSy1r1WutKpGPZUxNdnqmXq1EBbykanRX77ebXq"},"0x3c101c24c64a6d15a98de683329414ba8d25953aca39d04172ae4d3c394c9fa2":{"description":"I'm resubmitting my worker proposal using the ContributionReward Scheme as it would take more time to get the new QuickWalletScheme ready.

Full-time with 40 workable days/2 months\n\n**Position:** DXvoice coordinator, Community Leader, Internal Operations and Documentation\n\n**Background:** \n\nThis previous period had a large focus on organization and coordination of the DXvoice squad. This included the onboarding of @whatt4 who has been executing social strategies for DXdao and its products, and @international.blue who is transitioning into a creative director for the DAO. It has been a pleasure working with the two of them thus far and both have demonstrated strong enthusiasm. DXvoice has also been looking into actionable metrics and budget formalization -- authorizing its transition to a multi-chain multi-sig. \n\nFor context on the dates, I spent some time in March visiting Hawaii. I had one week fully disconnected, and another two partially. This varied day-by-day, but was roughly 50% on most days; with two of them extending further (blessed COW launch). As a result, I have put 9 workable days (5 days off + 8 days 50%  = 9) BETWEEN my previous proposal that are not compensated. To be clear, these inactivity windows were in March, but for ease of accounting for both DXdao and 0xKLOM.eth, the dates for these inactivity windows were adjusted to after the original proposal date.\n\n## Reflection on previous proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [March - April](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-contributor-proposal-for-03-2022-to-04-2022/3960), what I think I did well includes:\n\n- **Leadership and Coordination** - Although there is still much to overcome, DXvoice is at its strongest point ever. I've worked closely with Wayne and Dirk surrounding day-to-day operations and outlooks. We've also been digging through KPI's and budgetary organization, and aim to help bring the same coordination to all of DXdao's squads.\n\n- **Swapr and Carrot Deployments** - Although these are still more time consuming than I would like them to be, I feel as if the processes for discussing options and executing has been streamlined and campaigns have been consistently deployed without any hitches. Great job to everyone involved here.\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **Documentation Currency** - Things move quick at DXdao. Previously written and organized documentation quickly becomes out of date, inaccessible or otherwise. This coming period I want to keep myself on this pulse a bit closer, starting with a coming update of DXdao.eth and followed shortly thereafter with some DXdocs.eth changes.\n\n- **Marketing and Community** - Although in general these focuses are improving dramatically and have resulted in fantastic performance as of late, there is still much more structure to be introduced to marketing DXdao and its products. Alongside the aforementioned budget I plan on introducing frameworks to additional marketing initiatives, starting with increased community engagement, additional advertising related partnerships, and exploring influencer relationships.\n\n## Goals/Responsibilities:\n\n**[65%] DXvoice Coordination and Execution**\n\n* Lead DXdao’s “DXvoice” squad\n  * Organize, run, and manage various initiatives including but not limited to squad calls, marketing processes, community calls, events, content coordination, etc…\n  * Explore the potential for DXvoice to further become a more independent entity with its own goals. Content as a service? Etc…\n  * Coordinate DXvoice multi-sig execution\n    * Continue to monitor and input annual expenditure sheet\n* Keep third party representation of the DXdao brand consistent where possible\n  * Coingecko, CMC, BF, articles, etc…\n* Continue to push announcements and other content in waves via socials\n  * Encouraging third party involvement where feasible\n* Move forward as a figurehead for the DXdao Community\n* Continue creation and curation of Discord and its related initiatives\n  * Discord Quarterly REP boosts, etc\n* Elaborate on deadlines with Squad leads to cement strategy between DXvoice squad\n    * Current targets include Jolt, Carrot V1 and Guilds.\n* Write, Edit, and format content including announcements, MIR, social threads, etc…\n* Continue to work alongside design to build out landing pages and other UX;\n* Continue to manage and automate inflow\n  * User support, Bizdev opportunities, social media inflow, etc…\n* Further guide onboarding of new DXvoice contributors\n\n**[15%] Swapr and Carrot**\n\n* Reflect and explore upon [SWPR tokenomics](https://daotalk.org/t/swpr-token-and-swapr-guild/3118)\n    * Identify and guide a potential SWPR tokenomics upgrade\n* Guide the creation and deployment of monthly Carrot campaign proposals and call data\n* Actively manage and refine SWPR emission strategy\n* Guide the creation and deployment of monthly SWPR emissions proposals and call data\n* Communicate with partner projects and prospective partners surrounding emission schedule\n* Help push any Carrot front-end changes including introduction of new campaigns\n\n**[5%] Contributor Experience**\n\n* Continue to assist with the onboarding process\n* Help address contributor concerns, attend squad meetings\n* Guide community members through new Contributor Compensation Overhaul\n* Help maintain Open Positions document and Bounties, and export to DXdocs\n\n**[5%] DXdocs**\n\n* Continue to lead the [DXdocs effort ](https://dxdocs.eth.link/). Github [here](https://github.com/Mi-Lan/dxDaoBlog).\n  * Create and format associated text, run the project board and ensure relevant deadlines are met.\n* Coordinate documentation resources from all active DXdao products and squad\n\n**[5%] BizDev**\n\n* Assist BizDev squad\n  * Including DXventures, Swapr partnerships, etc…\n* Continue to cultivate Bizdev operations within DXdao social channels\n    * Including Collaboratory channels and roles within Discord, Twitter outreach, etc.\n* Seek opportunities and present to BizDev squad/relevant community members\n* Manage inflow from community social channels surrounding bizdev opportunities\n* Become an “Ambassador” as needed\n\n**[5%] QA**\n\n* Assist with QA on new releases/before new releases when needed\n\n## Compensation:\n\nThe previous proposals reflected an adjustment to the updated contributor guidelines. My personal context can be found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-contributor-proposal-for-01-2022-to-03-2022/3832#compensation-6). \n\n* Experience Level: 7\n* Full-time.\n* Month one.\n  * $9,000 (xDai) + $81 (xDai).\n  * $7,500 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n  * 0.1667% REP.\n* Month two.\n  * $9,000 (xDai) + $81 (xDai).\n  * $7,500 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n  * 0.1667% REP.\n\n$81 accounts for the previously specified $36 monthly community tool costs (statbot, yagpdb, etc…), as well as $45 monthly expenditure of Discord boosts to attain level 2 (Better audio quality, banner, community server status, etc). Although these community costs are still small, I plan on transitioning them to the multi-chain DXvoice multi-sig once authorized.\n\nThis proposal will request Month one’s xDai. The second proposal will request Month two’s xDai, and 0.3334% mainnet REP on GC at the end of the period. The second proposal will also specify owed % of mainnet REP, and owed DXD based on average price over the final month on Swapr provided it is above $523, otherwise $523 will be used.","title":"0xKLOM.eth Contributor Proposal for 05/2022 to 06/2022 1/2","hash":"QmdjDMdZmUcEgMVomvoRWVCEbn5cXdiDAyKpVdxaaE12pc"},"0x3c26e5af14f6c524ef8c8f32bb19fdbc86777acba84e70390cff89bb1e32e747":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

We have deadlines in place to get DXdocs V1.0 ready within roughly a week of this post going live.\n- This period I, more-so than previously, have been leading the organizational tasks for the Communications and Marketing squad. While I am personally not fully satisfied with our Marketing output in the previous period, I believe that we did a fantastic job given the various factors at play. (My time/focus was spread too wide, we had a lack of manpower and expenditure - lessened further by the loss of a squad member, etc…) We are also taking the right steps to rectify the present issues, through the onboarding of Caden and Kyle, and recruitment of a Senior marketing lead through PositionCo.\n\n### Things I think I could improve on:\n\n- I took on too wide of a responsibility pool and found myself stretched thin. There was a window where I found myself contributing much more than 40h/w, and made myself available from waking until sleep on Keybase/Discord/etc, which definitely wasn’t healthy and affected me personally. Massive thank you to those that recognised it and sent encouraging messages, I really appreciate it. I’d like to improve on this by adhering closer to an 8h window of availability, which I aim to ease into as the marketing and communications squad builds out.\n- I think I could have done more as a community leader. Particularly I had found that other urgent priorities superseded the windows I prepared to focus on the community. The solution here, related to the above, is to ensure I am not taking on more responsibilities than I have time to complete as an individual, and leveraging the growing communications and marketing squad when possible to free additional time.\n\n## Compensation:\n\nExperience Level: 4\n\nFull-time.\n\n- Month one.\n  - $7,036 (xDai).\n  - $5,000 (DXD). Vested for 2 years.\n  - 0.1667% REP.\n- Month two.\n  - $7,036 (xDai).\n  - $5,000 (DXD). Vested for 2 years.\n  - 0.1667% REP.\n\n*$36 accounts for the monthly community tool costs, as outlined in the previous proposal.*\n\nThis proposal is requesting Month two’s xDai, and 0.3334% mainnet REP on xDai. This proposal also indicates an owed 0.3334% of REP on mainnet, and owed 19.12 DXD.

Any delays to this progress or these initiatives can highly affect DXbiz Squad’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. However, even with major obstacles, the goal is always progress in the right direction.\n\n3) Days off: I plan to take time off during this summer period. I do not have dates identified at this point. However, once identified, these will be communicated and tracked and I will remove any from compensation in my payment proposal.","title":"SkyMine Labs Contributor Proposal 07/21 to 08/21","hash":"QmVXu3yRivoiWhiGk7DXkTLLCgWX4Pv7yotBDTwAswMegC"},"0x3f9bf50f75ad14afd37b8ba386ebb17f405eb7cfc9b9daf460ca9255e5676632":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

As of now, we've completed most of the core features planned for the MVP of Guilds already. The focus is now on finishing-up the remaining features as well as providing a polished user experience.\n\nWe've had quite a bit of changes to the DXgov team in the past couple of months, with a number of new devs joining, as well as Luli having to leave the team (although hopefully he'll be returning soon). A number of team members also participated in EthDenver events in February. We've made good progress even among multiple team changes and EthDenver.\n\n### Did well:\n\n* Continued development on the Guilds MVP\n* Improvements to DXvote\n    - Support for parallel connections to multiple networks. This will hopefully be very handy when we want to build more multi-chain features soon.\n    - Search by proposer wallet address or ENS name in DXvote search\n    - Flagging proposals as incorrect, when a proposer down-stakes their own proposal\n    - Security fixes to proposal renderer\n    - Fixes to ENS cache loading\n* Spent a lot of time researching multi-chain support, Ether-SWR implementation etc. \n* Collaborated a lot more with the team members, on brainstorming and code.\n\n### Improve on:\n\n* I had a lot of trouble with power and networking outages in the past few weeks, with all the craziness unfolding here in my home country. Now I have backup power and connectivity options, so hopefully it wouldn't continue to have an impact.\n* Smart contract development. I started working on smart contracts, although its been a lot of reading-up and learning than actually writing code. I'm expecting to focus more on this and work on open contracts issues soon.\n\n### Work completed:\n\n* Find my completed pull requests [here](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amprasanjith+is%3Aclosed).\n\n### Compensation:\n\n* $7000 DAI to be sent on the second payment proposal\n* $5000 DXD in a vesting contract continuously for three years, when the work agreement finishes (01/03/22)\n* 0.1667% REP, to be sent on the second payment proposal","title":"Madusha - Contributor Proposal [01/01/2022 - 01/03/2022] - Second Half","hash":"QmPcDVeQTGp7CyW4snAKGhfSN86ZEr2mJfXj7FFfcMhdbM"},"0x3fe35e33bfe91259ac39a0573d99f77042a695bbf5740c2c3c1d2549d3c3085f":{"description":"Space Inch is a development studio that has been providing contract work across Aqua and now Swapr.

Full-time with 40 workable days/2 months\n\n**Position**: Lead of Communications and Marketing\n\n## Reflection on 05 - 07 proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [May - July](https://daotalk.org/t/keenan-luke-contributor-proposal-for-05-2021-to-07-2021/2957), things I think I did well include:\n\n* This period I finalized and pushed **DXdocs V1.0** to a very positive initial response. I think there is a lot that can continue to flow into DXdocs as the community begins to utilize it to its full extent, and I am incredibly excited to guide that path forward with our documentation resource. \n\n* **Community calls!** I am incredibly happy with the outcome of changing our resource coordination call to a bi-weekly community call. This has really brought out engagement within the community, and continues grow in success each iteration.\n\n* I also was deeply involved in the process of creating the **DXdao contributor compensation overhaul** including complementary material such as the DXD release and stable release calculator. Although this is yet to see an on-chain vote, discussion (and criticism) have been productive and I am happy with where we are today and where the discussion could continue to move to.\n\n* Finally, **squad leadership and coordination**. I wouldn't consider this perfect, but since the previous proposal where I had formally pushed into an organizational and leadership driven position, the output of DXvoice has increased considerably. DXdao and Swapr Twitter have had their most successful month by a considerable margin, content and other initiatives are more frequent then ever before. This was accomplished through our weekly coordination calls and through the recent squad onboardings.\n\n### Things I think I could improve on:\n\n* I had indicated an interest in beginning the inklings of **thought leadership** in my previous proposal. Although I pushed forward with my community leadership position through Discord leadership, social moderation, and interviews such as DIGIFIZZY and Publish0x; I didn't do much on the thought leadership side of things due to commitment constraints.

Approach new issues with a “TDD” perspective\n- PR reviews have been a constant pain point in our development process. I’ll allocate the first hour of the day to reviews to improve on it.\n- Read more books. Specifically, start and finish “Working effectively with legacy code” and incorporate its insights into my Obsidian vault. I don’t know if this is related to my proposal, but I thought I could add it here to keep myself accountable.\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\n- Work full-time per the bi-weekly planning session on smart contracts and front-end issues\n- Attend the daily calls, weekly relevant (for my role) calls, bi-weekly planning sessions, and other meetings.\n- Participate in the governance process\n\n**Compensation**\n\nLevel increase\n\nThis current proposal includes a level increase from 2 → 3.\n\nThe experience guidelines for level 3 state:\n\nI have skills and experience in Web3/DeFi/DAOs that translate directly to DXdao. I can provide value to key initiatives for DXdao but need guidance on how to complete and check tasks.\n\nThe level increase was brought up by squad members during the discussion of my last proposal (here 2, and here 1). I obviously can’t be objective, but I do feel that the description fits my current role.\n\nThe compensation calculations are based on that assumption.\n\n**Timeframe**\n\nTwo periods:\n\n16/10/2022 - 15/11/2022\n\n16/11/2022 - 15/12/2022\n\n**Compensation**\n\nExperience level: 3\n\nTime commitment: full-time (40 hours per week)\n\nMonth 1 [16/10/2022 - 15/11/2022]\n\n5.000 DAI\n\n3.000 DXD, vested for 3 years with a 1-year cliff starting 15/11/2022\n\n0.1667% REP\n\nMonth 2 [16/11/2022 - 15/12/2022]\n\n5.000 DAI\n\n3.000 DXD, vested for 3 years with a 1-year cliff starting 15/12/2022\n\n0.1667% REP\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n**Retrospective**\n\n**Did well**\n\nFix the issues reported in the audit: as a team, we tackled the Omega audit and could successfully deliver the codebase with the fixes they suggested.\n\nMy focus was mainly on fixing failing tests and improving coverage. This helped me enormously to understand the architecture and logic of the Gov 1.5 contracts (and scratched my test itch, but that’s on me). I also worked on removing SafeMath and adding custom errors to some of the contracts to improve gas efficiency.\n\nImplementing TheGraph: we put a lot of focus on developing subgraphs, both for the current Guild contracts and the Gov 1.5 contracts. We worked on this doing “pair programming,” and the results were fantastic. We have working subgraph versions (running locally) for both governance systems and architecture logic to retrieve data from TheGraph, but we still have the contract calls as a fallback. The next phase will be to polish and finish the last details, deploy the subgraphs, and code the logic for fetching.\n\nFeatures and fixes in DAVI: my most significant contribution in this period was the implementation of event listeners for data refetching. This led to a major wagmi update (from 0.5 to 0.7.15) that, since it is a core library in DAVI, required significant changes and debugging but resulted in a substantial performance improvement (PR) and RPC calls reduction.\nI finished and merged two features started in the previous period: a raw transaction builder that allows (advanced) users to create actions using raw data; and the ability to use ENS names or addresses interchangeably in every address input.\n\nPR reviews: Since we pair-programmed a lot during this period, we had fewer open PRs than in other periods. I can’t say I allocated 1 hour for review every day, sometimes because there were no new changes to review and other times because I got caught up with finishing what I was currently doing. Overall, I did a fair job reviewing them, but I can still improve.\n\n**Needs improvement**\n\nTDD: I need to overcome the initial hurdle of thinking about tests first instead of diving into the code and start changing things. This doesn’t mean, however, that the code was untested (I added tests when implementing changes) but that it wasn’t made with the “TDD” framework.\n\nWorking effectively with legacy code (book): I left it halfway through. Even though the concepts were excellent (how to write tests for untested code that wasn’t built with tests in mind), the examples and cases were in Java. This made it hard for me to fully grasp what the code was doing and extract value from some cases that weren’t relevant. However, I found a course from Kent C. Dodds aimed at implementing tests in JavaScript (testingjavascript.com), so I’ll go for it instead for the next period.\n\nGovernance: I didn’t actively participate in the governance process as I had hoped. I attended the weekly calls but missed reading most of the contributor proposals and voting on them on-chain.\n\n**Proof of work**\n\n- Allow ens addresses for address input\n- Raw transaction builder\n- Component break after decimal value\n- Upgraded wagmi, TypeScript and implemented event listeners to refetch data\n- TokenAmountInput auto-formatting issue\n- Refactor Schemes: increased coverage, replaced SafeMath and added custom errors\n- Remove SafeMath from some smart contracts\n- Fix failing tests [G3]\n- Guilds subgraph repo ( * )\n- 1.5 contracts\n\n subgraph repo ( * )\n\n( * ) This was the first version of the subgraph implementation. We pair-programmed through most of it, so individual PRs won’t reflect the work done\n\n\n\n----------\n\n**15 day period**\n\n\nGiven that the following proposal will be made in DAVI, and to save making a proposal for just two weeks (15/dec → 31/dec), I think it is better to extend the scope of this proposal until the end of the year since the goals and responsibilities of it remain the same.

Making a new repo for DAVI (former Guilds), bettering code quality with unit tests, integration tests (we introduced Storybook), and e2e-tests. We also took a stab at fixing our smart contracts from the audit reports we received back. Although, a busy period as always, I felt like alignment and productivity in the team were at an all-time high.\n\nOn a personal note - somehow I passed the finish line. This period marks my end as a part-time contributor and my start as a full-time contributor :tada:. I’ve expressed this many times previously, but I am grateful to the team for their support and understanding throughout this hectic period.\n\nAfter a short vacation, I’ll be back.\n\n### Went well\nImproved code quality across the board with unified code style, tests, and in general, more alignment on how to work on the code base together.\n\nGood spirit in tackling the problems addressed in the audit reports. I felt everyone took responsibility to learn more about the issues and to better understand our smart contracts. On a personal note, I am really enjoying writing/modifying and learning more about our smart contracts. I am hoping to take a bigger part here in the future.\n\nWe got QA! I’m personally very excited about working closer with the QA to improve the products from DXgov. I’ve already seen issues being raised, which we’ll hopefully solve to make a viable and great product.\n\n### Could have done better\nDuring this period, prioritizing and properly managing my time has continuously proven to be difficult. Since I’ll be transitioning into a full-time contributor, I expect my time management to be fully resolved by only having a single full-time commitment.\n\nCommunication. Trying to coordinate the team while working remotely, asynchronously, and across different time zones is a modern problem. I, myself, has been vocal about being clearer in our communication by writing more decision documents and other types of tools that allows contributors to work more asynchronous, instead of using the Keybase chat for decisions. But, I am also guilty of poor communication regarding availability and such.

Successful passage of this proposal greenlights eligible Discord participants to their respective mainnet REP allocation, to be claimed through GC.\n\nYou can find the previous signal proposal [here](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x5e1617ca4b3b6d1ebed7c576eaaf428241e6a77c3407b578af82f4c71002c6bf). The forum thread can be found below:\n\n## Background\n\nSince Q1 of 2021, DXvoice has organized a quarterly REP boost that targets community activity and retention. Now, more than a year later, there have been five successful Discord REP boosts. As usual, this will need to pass through governance as a signal before users are eligible to claim. Here is some context from the original proposal:\n\n> With the introduction of the DXdao Discord server, @KeenanLuke has proposed an initiative to get more community members involved in Governance. A governance gateway drug, if you will. This functions as a quarterly allocation; a way for us to leave the door open to those most active in the community to further involvement with DXdao and its governance.\n\nIn its current configuration, the DXdao Discord server tracks a user's participation in the preceding quarter and assigns a role based on quantity and quality of the engagement. More information explaining this is coming soon directly within Discord.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nThe below list contains all users eligible for a boost, their respective level, and the allocation of mainnet REP they are entitled to receive. Active DXdao contributors are not eligible for this initiative, and have been removed from the list. Anyone nominated for a [traditional community REP boost](https://daotalk.org/t/community-rep-boosts-apr-2021/2850) is still eligible for this initiative, since high levels are difficult to obtain and the REP is distributed quarterly instead of monthly.\n\nAlthough the entitlement is in mainnet REP, it is highly advised that community members request their REP via DXdao’s Gnosis Chain base - where governance contract interaction is a fraction of a cent. Anyone is welcome to reach out to @KeenanLuke, or any other community member involved with governance, requesting a small amount of xDai to make their REP request proposal and start voting!\n\nIf no concerns have arisen within a few days of this post being live, @KeenanLuke will create a signal proposal on Gnosis Chain to update this initiative. If the proposal passes, @KeenanLuke will notify those who are eligible and assist in the claiming process by updating the “DXdao Discord REP Boost Guide”.

A retrospective on my past proposal period can be found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/madusha-contributor-proposal-01-03-2022-30-04-2022/4010#a-retrospective-1). Within the current proposal period, the plan is to start refactoring DXvote, integrating the new Guilds UI and a better cache implementation.\n\n### Proposed Scope of Contribution\n\nI will continue to work on shipping Guilds and will contribute to the DXvote refactoring efforts.\n\n1. Goals:\n\n  * Continue supporting the Guilds development, finishing up remaining work and fixing any bugs we find in testing.\n  * Work on refactoring the DXvote user interface and caching implementation. We will be integrating the new Guilds UI into DXvote. The cache implementation will be rebuilt, with a focus on maintainability, loading speeds and efficiency.\n  * Improve the developer experience and overall code quality.\n\n2. Responsibilities:\n\n  * Collaborate with DXgov members to build and improve our governance products.\n  * Keep DXvote development efforts on-track, according to the Attack Plan.\n  * Actively engage in improving the Guilds developer experience and ways of working.\n\n### Time commitment\n\n* Full-time (40 hours / week)\n* I’m currently planning a move to Europe in the latter half of the year. I’m unsure how the visa process for this will affect the hours I will be able to work. If it is significantly affected, I will be reducing the number of hours I request payment for, in the second half of my proposal.\n\n### Compensation\n\nExperience Level: 5\n\n* $14000 ($7000 * 2) to be sent half on the first payment proposal, and half on the second payment proposal\n* $10000 DXD ($5000 * 2) vested for three years\n* 0.3334% REP (0.1667 * 2), to be sent half on the first payment proposal, and half on the second payment proposal\n\n### Work Experience\n\n1.

This included pulling all REP holder addresses and addresses of wallets that participated in the DXD bonding curve, screening them with blockchain investigations software, breaking down the results by risk score, and manually investigating wallet addresses the software scored as risky.\n\n(-) Struggled to generate useful analysis on LPs to Omen. When I began, I was unable to query several relevant contracts in Dune Analytics (was receiving a permission denied error that no one was able to decipher). About a month and a half later I was able to query the contracts, but struggled to associate the addresses emitted by the contracts with the party ultimately responsible for effectuating the transactions. I asked for help from several Omen squad members: @KadenZipfel provided some help, but I struggled to implement some of his suggestions. I also reached out to @0xVenky but I missed the first call we had scheduled, and he has been very busy with other Omen related tasks since.\n\nLessons learned:\n\n15 hours a week is unrealistic : While I have worked 15 hours a week some weeks, specifically during the blockchain investigation, most weeks I have worked closer to 6-7 hours a week (because I was blocked technically or waiting for folks to get back to me with guidance/feedback). I spent a lot of that time debugging errors in Dune Analytics and The Graph. So, my next worker proposal will be for fewer hours a week. \n\nBringing on support for technical tasks: The Omen team is very busy and I don’t think it’s realistic to receive hand-holding on analytics tasks. To that end I have identified a data engineer and a machine learning engineer who are interested in Web3 governance and prediction markets respectively. I will work with the machine learning engineer to generate those metrics. I will also work with the data engineer to develop metrics on REP holder engagement for a project @Tammy is working on. By offloading some of this technical work to interested parties I will be freed up to focus on where I can add the most value; working on compliance and legal issues with @Tammy. 3 days after providing the ML engineer with some background on the Omen FPMMs, he was able to mostly complete the analysis.\n\nTl;dr; I enjoy working with DXdao but I need to refocus on tasks that are suited for my skill-set.

In order to save on gas costs, this authorization proposal allows for the ETH already in the multisig to be used towards the diversification outlined in this proposal.\n\nDetails on 2): Put $5m of these USD-stable assets into yield-earning protocols\n\nDXdao introduces the idea of DXyield: Given that DXdao will be holding a sizable position in USD-stable assets, DXdao will be seeking yield with its USD stable tokens.\n\nThis proposal authorizes use of Compound, Aave and Yearn protocols.\n\nThe first yield earning protocol for DXdao would likely be Compound protocol followed by Aave and/or Yearn.\n\nAny other community suggestions would be welcomed via separate investment memo and Proposal.\n\nFor reference, you can find some yield reference rates here: [Crypto Lending Rates - Earn Crypto Interest by DeFi Lending 1](https://defirate.com/lend/)\n\nThere is currently no defined plan to hold non-USD based stable assets, but this topic should be looked into and addressed via alternative forum post and proposal.\n\nDetails on 3): Explore ETH yield and other yield opportunities with up to 1,000 ETH\n\nThe goal here is to earn yield on ETH that DXdao holds. Any community suggestions would be welcomed via separate investment memo and Proposal.\n\nMethods outlined:\n\nAgain the most trustless method for DXdao to rebalance its treasury is to use the Gnosis Protocol Relayer that DXdao will soon be connected to via the Multicall Scheme. This should eventually be the primary, and perhaps only, way in which DXdao rebalances its treasury. However, the multi-call proposal will take a couple weeks to pass and then each relayer proposal will take roughly one additional week and also it would make sense to ramp up the size of the relayer trades somewhat gradually. Therefore, it could take more than a couple months to move a significant portion of the treasury into stablecoins by using the Gnosis Protocol Relayer alone. With ETH nearing its all time highs, it is important for DXdao to accelerate the treasury diversification process. This proposal authorizes diversification through the following 3 means:\n\n1) Gnosis Protocol Relayer\nWhen the Multicall scheme is installed, the Gnosis Protocol Relayer will become available for use. While it will make sense for DXdao to start small with this newly deployed system, this method is the most trustless, and this authorization proposal places no limits on the amount traded via the Gnosis Protocol Relayer towards the listed conversion target of $5M.\n\nNote: If Gnosis Protocol is no longer active, other methods that DXdao can execute itself should be explored in place of Gnosis Protocol.\n\n2) DXdao Developer MultiSig\nThis proposal authorizes any amount towards the listed conversion target of $5M to be traded via the [DXdao Dev multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x5F239a6671BC6d2bAEf6D7Cd892296e678810882/), granted that no more than 250 ETH is transferred to the DXdao Dev mutlisig in a 2 day period, that the multisig executes trades within one day of receiving each disbursement, and that the multisig currently requires signatures of at least 3 of 7 addresses, owned by distinct REP holders with greater than 1% REP that have verified ownership of their multisig member address by signing a message with the multisig member address and including this message in a Keybase saltpack signed message along with the address that holds their REP and presenting this verification in an alchemy proposal (or the same REP wallet). Note that some REP holding addresses are Gnosis Safes which unfortunately lack the ability to sign messages and also can’t be members of the multisig, and therefore, this verification process relies on keybase profile identities.\n\n3) “Member Balancer” Trading\nThe “Member Balancer” approach incentivizes third parties to send stablecoins to the treasury and ask for ETH in return. This allows DXdao to diversify its treasury without having to trust an intermediary, but does require the third parties to trust DXdao and for DXdao to provide some incentive. This proposal authorizes that 1.01 times an amount of ETH may be requested via alchemy proposal by a third party granted that they have traded that amount of ETH for stablecoins on a highly liquid DEX and transferred the stablecoins to DXdao no earlier than 2 hours before the proposal. If the proposer is not trading ETH for said stablecoins, for example because they already are holding the stablecoins, they may use the fair market value of ETH as reported by Coingecko at the time of request granted that the transfer of stablecoins has been made no earlier than 2 hours before the proposal. Furthermore, this proposal limits the amount that may be traded via the “Member Balancer” approach to $2M and requires that a minimum size trade per proposal should be 30 ETH.","title":"(xDXdao Duplicate of) Signal Proposal: Treasury Diversification Authorization Program - v2","hash":"QmYNMXCB6W6H2ZMEELSYgNmH1qAZqboiTKwSY19oFNJxpL"},"0x46f0ac019eee27656d4c8adcb72d6a8f3461ba0357eedd71af251f7c9cdf838b":{"description":"This proposals unwraps 500k wxDai into Dai using a generic multischeme call.\n\nA test transaction has been submitted here: https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/xdai/proposal/0xb69232369d7d7a9440cdc5482b3904fd3b6b80ed2a0daee23eacf6f12f24bb04 with this proposal passing after the test proposal.

I'm Kenny (@vangrim on Keybase) and a full-stack Web3 developer part of the DxGov team. The DxGov team is currently in charge of building and launching DAVI (previously Guilds), a necessary step upon which Governance 2.0 will be built.\n\nFor the next period, DXgov will continuously work with DAVI, writing smart contracts to support the operations, and lastly to finally launch DAVI into open beta (if everything goes as expected).\n\n## Proposed Scope of Contribution:\n\n### Goals:\n\n* Deploy DAVI for the closed beta on the Goerli Test network for several DAOs/guilds including Swapr and DXD. \n\n* I proposed a release strategy to QA and the squad. For the next period, I want to work closer with @ross, the squad, and QA to formalize and implement this release strategy. This will be essential for our development cycles going forward into **open beta**.\n\n* After the audit concerning our v2 contracts, we will start to plan and implement Subgraph. Subgraph will be used to support our contracts and create stability and speed (we are currently lacking in DxVote for example).\n\n* In Bogota, we will gather the squad to write a tech specification for the Voting Machine. This is an important step toward Governance 2.0 (maybe the most important?).\n\n* If the [proposal](https://daotalk.org/t/augustol-contributor-work-proposal-7/4510/6) passes, cooperate with @AugustoL to be a bigger part of the Solidity development at DxDAO. Working on issues cross-squads.\n\n* Continue to work on the roadmap of DxGov, this includes: maintaining the product, implementing new designs and features, assisting QA, and continuing to work on currently existing issues as can be seen [here](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/issues).\n\n* Continue to be active in governance and initiatives in DxDAO outside of DxGov development activities which include active governance on the forum and on-chain, weekly business/development/product strategy/governance calls, and other related activities.\n\n## Responsibilities:\n\n* Continue to develop DAVI and smart contracts related to DXgov.\n* Maintain and develop processes together with the development squad and the QA team to ensure a holistic product experience (maintenance, development, QA, development processes).\n* Be an active participant in forming more transparent ways of working (working agreements, technical decisions, mob sessions, sprint planning, etc.) in DXgov.\n* Support the squad with day-to-day operations such as code reviews, pair programming, brainstorming, and other tech-related tasks.\n* Be communicative and involved in DXgov’s mission during sprint planning, daily standups, DXdao meetings, etc.\n* Set aside time to help govern DXdao (from voting on proposals to discussing topics and helping/starting initiatives.\n\n## Time commitment:\n\n* Full time (40hr/week)\n\n## Experience Level:\n\n* **Level 4** \n\n## Compensation\n\n* $6000 ($6000 * 2) to be sent half on the first payment proposal, and half on the second payment proposal\n* $4000 ($4000 * 2) DXD - Vested for three years with a 1-year cliff starting the 18 September 2022.\n* First payment proposal: 0.1667% REP.\n* Second payment proposal: 0.1667% REP\n\nI will also be asking for the remainder of the stipend for [DXBogota](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/xdai/proposal/0x62fb4da3c53ae8c70710acf49f9771a7f7b84ec36ce502a65dc2fd57f592bfc5)\n* DevCon ticket: $299. \n\n**NOTE**: The above compensation will be provided through DevX AG (@DevX) e.g. devx.eth.\n\n## Work Experience:\n\n* 2+ years of experience building applications on React, TypeScript, Node.js, and many back-end-related frameworks.\n* 3+ years as a privacy lawyer.

The extension on the buyback program was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/extend-dxd-buyback-program-for-another-1m-draft-proposal/3319). This funding proposal and the subsequent trade proposal use an updated version of the GP Relayer than the one referenced in the DXD Buyback Program Signal Proposal in order to add Swapr to the GP Relayer’s exchangeFactoryWhitelist.\n\nThe DXD Buyback Program Signal proposal stipulates that the purchase amount should be based on the DXD Average Daily Trading Volume (ADTV). [According to the most recent on-chain data and estimates](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmU1gB6iJbEgxK2BF9ugmH4LSzmwqSA934jb8Y3aieTwtk), DXD has averaged $146k over the last 3 months, so this proposal sends 9.59 WETH to the GP relayer on xDai, identified as `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`, using a [$3806.91 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum).

This proposal was also posted on daotalk [here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-proposed-legal-budget-2021-q4/3370).\n\nThis is an initial signal proposal for a Q4 legal budget. Not all funds will be requested at once on-chain. Instead, I will update this forum post as items are requested on-chain with additional specifics regarding the request and any changes in cost and conversion rates.\n\nTotal requested: $38,670\n\nAn itemized list is below: \n\n1. Research on How DAOs Can Interface with Territories and Legal Jurisdictions → MME\n\nFounded as a decentralized on-chain organization, the DXdao community has chosen to operate without a legal entity. DXdao’s decentralization-first model is producing innovative governance tools that other DAOs have emulated and established a solid foundation for how we work.\n\nAs DXdao’s day-to-day operations grow, researching and exploring how DAOs interface with territorial jurisdictions becomes important. This research will explore legal structuring for DXdao’s contributors’ on-chain activities in the real world.\n\nWith DXdao’s commitment to decentralization in mind, @fluidrop and I contacted Swiss law firm, MME. Back in 2016, MME assisted the Ethereum Foundation in setting up its legal entity, and MME is now heavily researching legal structuring options for DAOs. Given MME’s experience and interest in blockchain law, the attorneys at MME will be a strong legal partner to explore how DAOs build organizational structures that can interface with real world territories and legal jurisdictions.\n\nOnce retained, MME will review DXdao’s governance, treasury, and products to provide an initial regulatory and tax analysis on how DXdao and its contributors can interface with the “Web2 world”. I will then workshop with MME to compile some research on DAO legal structuring options. This information will be shared with the DXdao and larger DeFi community to help others working in this space.\n\nCost: 15,000.00 CHF ($16,278 +122 tx* = $16,400)\n\n2. Legal Opinion on United Kingdom Registration Laws → McDonnell Ellis\n\nThe United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority has implemented registration requirements for entities and sole practitioners that engage in the issuance and / or exchange of crypto currencies. Given DXdao’s unique situation as a DAO, it’s necessary to obtain a legal opinion on whether there is any need to register under the new law.\n\nMcDonnell Ellis is a boutique financial services law firm that will review DXdao’s decentralized structure and technology to give a written opinion on whether the registration requirements may apply.\n\nCost: 3,000.00 £ ($4,148 + 122 tx* = $4,270)\n\n3. Blockchain Analysis Report and Recommendations → Guidehouse\n\nGuidehouse is an analytics and strategy consulting agency that Chainalysis referred to DXdao to complete a blockchain analysis and report of (1) DXD bonding curve purchasers, (2) REP holder addresses, and (3) Swapr token airdrop holders.\n\nThe report is necessary in order to continue to provide grants to projects and undergo efforts to not engage with or receive funds from any sanctioned persons on the UN OFAC sanctions lists. Guidehouse will also give recommendations on policies and procedures to be compliant with AML laws.\n\nI’m still waiting to receive a final quote from Guidehouse.\n\nEst. Cost: $10,000.00\n\n4. Ongoing Retention → Polsinelli LLP\n\nPolsinelli was first retained in April 2021 to assist with compliance and remediation questions in the United States. DXdao has an ongoing relationship with Polsinelli that has been useful to guide product strategy to date. Polsinelli has not sent a new bill from the initial $5,000 retainer, but it could be expected that the retainer may need to be refilled in the 4th fiscal quarter.\n\nEst. Cost: $5,000.00\n\n5. Miscellaneous\n\nThis item intends to cover any additional expenses that individual contributors will need covered regarding legal and compliance concerns during the 4th fiscal quarter.\n\nEst. Cost: $3,000.00\n\nAny comments and feedback on the Q4 Legal Budget proposal are appreciated.\n\n  ","title":"Legal Budget Q4 Signal Proposal ","hash":"QmaXmDWjPwisxfvLs8SsrBeHR7c8yQD4gkhRezecg24XRE"},"0x49833c8e693b784e6c141224cecce6cdb5e9c3c34c8611b5127ccc8055329914":{"description":"# Incubation Grant\n\nWith this proposal DXdao incubates Nimi.eth and allocates $100k in the form of an incubation grant to the Nimi.eth team as well as incubation support for 6 months.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis new style of “incubating” products allows the DAO to fund new projects, without having to commit years of funding to them. Providing a smaller grant and initial support to projects allows them to prove themselves in the market and seek outside capital.\n\n6 months is a good time-frame for projects to ship product, get initial adoption and most importantly find a product-market fit.\n\n## Overview Nimi\n\nIn its current form Nimi.eth acts as a decentralised social aggregator - allowing users to actually own and control their own Nimi page hosted on their own ENS domain. Currently, less than 1% of ENS addresses have a content hash set (source: [Dune](https://dune.com/makoto/ens)).\n\nNimi currently has a partnership with the eth.limo team, whereby an ENS without content hash set resolves to a default Nimi page see: [shaq.eth.limo ](https://shaq.eth.limo/)\n\nWe see Nimi as the social aggregator / personal profile page in web3. Where users have full ownership of their web3 presence.\n\nWe want to be the default option to connect at conferences, rather than sharing Telegram QR code, sharing your Nimi QR code! We’re looking to implement additional functionality to enable such connections, including NFTs representing connections on-chain which could give access to further information (i.e. email address) based on degrees of connection - fully customizable by users themselves.\n\nWe also see a great opportunity in the creative space, most web3 artists today use linktree as the default link in their twitter bio. We see a vast opportunity in building Nimi into a product that suits the needs of creators much better. I.e. showcasing and being able to sell NFTs directly from your Nimi page!\n\nOutside of the existing web3 user base, we also want to make it our mission to onboard new users into web3 and ENS - focusing on creating a user-friendly UI/UX experience.\n\nDeck from presentation on 15th of August 2022 on BizDev Call: [https://nimi.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbS4uqbuaoT5DmoA2kwJ3EQd7cELJL7gj6EPabffCZsUz ](https://nimi.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbS4uqbuaoT5DmoA2kwJ3EQd7cELJL7gj6EPabffCZsUz)\n\n## Nimi <> DXdao\n\nNimi was born out of the ETHAmsterdam Hackathon we were attending on behalf of DXdao and there are a lot of shared values in this journey.\n\nDXdao has long been one of the few active DAOs using ENS domains to host its DAPPs. Nimi is in a strong position onboarding individual users to hosting on ENS and increasing overall awareness of the possibility of hosting on an ENS domain and how to access the domains in a regular browser. Through the incubation grant, Nimi will be able to rely upon DXdaos expertise in web3 development, bizdev and marketing.\n\nWe believe Nimi can also be a great opportunity to raise awareness of DXdao and its products. Nimi is targeting individual users who are active in web3 as its initial target audience. It’d be great to work together on exposure with DXdao, hosting twitter and discord spaces together, driving new Nimi users to checkout DXdao and perhaps even co-sponsoring conferences and events. We’re also open to any other suggestions on how we could raise awareness together.\n\n## Details\n\nAs part of the incubation, DXdao will allow Nimi to build out their project under the DXdao umbrella allowing the Nimi team to rely on the expertise and know-how of DXdao.\n\n* Nimi team can allocate 40% time to Nimi - for up to 6 months\n* DXdao funds the Nimi MS with $100k\n* DXdao receives a 10% stake in Nimi\n\nIf passed, this proposal sends 100k USDC to the Nimi MS identified as: 0x4e675ceB415fC41700fb821fF3B43cE5C8B9a83B","title":" Nimi Incubation Grant - DXVentures [Mirror Proposal]","hash":"QmNtvp5Z4pp1g5cR9itddfo9sf2QDxVKFjmjYJjUrsWtcT"},"0x49a664eed517d652cb21bbb06024ec7b18d2f21125c66a4cfb24fd2628ba6f35":{"description":"This proposal withdraws the xDai, wxDai, WETH and USDC in the Swapr Relayer https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x3921d59090810c1d52807cd8ca1ea2289e1f89e6 to the DXdao Treasury.","title":"Withdraw ETH & Tokens in Swapr LP Relayer","hash":"QmNodcCsLudezrusPDN7eh48SYFhiU73A74UxD3YyitUxd"},"0x49aa862fe9363c31a2cd8c26fc1e6ff22b96e9d221b227a1da5ecd48a435ae40":{"description":"\nThis is an onchain proposal for Q4 Legal Budget item 1.

I'm Kenny (@vangrim on Keybase) and a full-stack Web3 developer part of the DxGov team. The DxGov team is currently in charge of building and launching DAVI (previously Guilds), a necessary step upon which Governance 2.0 will be built.\n\nFor the next period, DXgov will continuously work with DAVI, writing smart contracts to support the operations, and lastly to finally launch DAVI into open beta (if everything goes as expected).\n\n## Proposed Scope of Contribution:\n\n### Goals:\n\n* Deploy DAVI for the closed beta on the Goerli Test network for several DAOs/guilds including Swapr and DXD. \n\n* I proposed a release strategy to QA and the squad. For the next period, I want to work closer with @ross, the squad, and QA to formalize and implement this release strategy. This will be essential for our development cycles going forward into **open beta**.\n\n* After the audit concerning our v2 contracts, we will start to plan and implement Subgraph. Subgraph will be used to support our contracts and create stability and speed (we are currently lacking in DxVote for example).\n\n* In Bogota, we will gather the squad to write a tech specification for the Voting Machine. This is an important step toward Governance 2.0 (maybe the most important?).\n\n* If the [proposal](https://daotalk.org/t/augustol-contributor-work-proposal-7/4510/6) passes, cooperate with @AugustoL to be a bigger part of the Solidity development at DxDAO. Working on issues cross-squads.\n\n* Continue to work on the roadmap of DxGov, this includes: maintaining the product, implementing new designs and features, assisting QA, and continuing to work on currently existing issues as can be seen [here](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/issues).\n\n* Continue to be active in governance and initiatives in DxDAO outside of DxGov development activities which include active governance on the forum and on-chain, weekly business/development/product strategy/governance calls, and other related activities.\n\n## Responsibilities:\n\n* Continue to develop DAVI and smart contracts related to DXgov.\n* Maintain and develop processes together with the development squad and the QA team to ensure a holistic product experience (maintenance, development, QA, development processes).\n* Be an active participant in forming more transparent ways of working (working agreements, technical decisions, mob sessions, sprint planning, etc.) in DXgov.\n* Support the squad with day-to-day operations such as code reviews, pair programming, brainstorming, and other tech-related tasks.\n* Be communicative and involved in DXgov’s mission during sprint planning, daily standups, DXdao meetings, etc.\n* Set aside time to help govern DXdao (from voting on proposals to discussing topics and helping/starting initiatives.\n\n## Time commitment:\n\n* Full time (40hr/week)\n\n## Experience Level:\n\n* **Level 4** \n\n## Compensation\n\n* $6000 ($6000 * 2) to be sent half on the first payment proposal, and half on the second payment proposal\n* $4000 ($4000 * 2) DXD - Vested for three years with a 1-year cliff starting the 18 September 2022.\n* First payment proposal: 0.1667% REP.\n* Second payment proposal: 0.1667% REP\n\nI will also be asking for the remainder of the stipend for [DXBogota](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/xdai/proposal/0x62fb4da3c53ae8c70710acf49f9771a7f7b84ec36ce502a65dc2fd57f592bfc5)\n* DevCon ticket: $299. \n\n**NOTE**: The above compensation will be provided through DevX AG (@DevX) e.g. devx.eth.\n\n## Work Experience:\n\n* 2+ years of experience building applications on React, TypeScript, Node.js, and many back-end-related frameworks.\n* 3+ years as a privacy lawyer.

After attending EthCC and meeting everyone in Paris my mind was decided. I have been super happy working at DXdao and on Aqua these past few months, getting more involved has been very rewarding and I am so excited for my future working here. And I just wanted to thank everyone here (especially @Melanie and @JohnKelleher) for all the amazing support I have got over the past few months, I couldn’t be happier to be in this position and being a part of DXdao.\n\nNow DXdao can officially claim to be taking employees from traditional finance.\n\n**Goals:**\n\nFully launch an official public MVP beta of Aqua (fixed price sales)\nStable release\nHandle suggestions/support\nCoordinate launching of sales (DXD, NFT marketing sales)\nBegin fully prioritised work on fairsale mechanism integration\nHave a well communicated message about Aqua supported by a detailed DXdocs page with branding\nContinue taking a more full stack approach to development and encouraging the rest of the team to do so also\nContinue learning and strengthening my knowledge of web3 development - specifically improving on my debugging ability and speed\nETHLisbon - I want to take a larger part in representing DXdao at our next in person event. Also of course getting to know everyone even better.\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\nBalancing project management tasks as well as development tasks of Aqua\nLeading Aqua calls and representing the project in DXdao calls\nAqua product direction and roadmap\nCoordinating between different teams in DXdao for releases, sales and future work\nManaging the project on github and developer assignment on issues\nTaking an overall larger part in the direction of DXdao\n\n**Self Reflection on previous worker proposal:**\n\nMy previous worker proposal (first after trial period) covered the time from the beginning of Martin’s compensation discussion through to now. Since then quite a lot has changed. The initial responsibilities listed focused mainly on improving my skills and implementing remaining parts of the fixed price sale MVP. However as Martin left DXdao these responsibilities and goals changed slightly to include more management focused activities as I volunteered to keep the team running. Due to my university dissertation deadline and overlapping EthCC I worked less at the beginning of the previous proposal and more towards the middle/end, balancing out to just over an average of 15 hours a week.\n\n**Did well:**\nDevelopment - I think my main responsibilities as a developer I did well over the past 2 months. Most of my time was focused on UI development which has gone well and progressed well with MVP.\nUI upgrade to v0.1.1 - One of the development efforts I worked on was integrating the UI with the new SC and subgraph version 0.1.1 upgrade for MVP release. These sorts of tasks are something fairly unique to the web 3 world and I feel it went fairly smoothly. It also made a large impact on the state of Aqua and progress towards MVP since it is the major version the MVP will use when launched.\nPlanning and coordinating Aqua - Since volunteering to keep Aqua going in the right direction I think I have done a good job with coordinating the team and the application. A few examples are running the daily standups, weekly planning as well as one off discussions such as the roadmap planning to prioritise future development efforts for Aqua. Recently, I have reached out to the DXvoice team to organise branding and communication for Aqua. I have also started coordinating potential sales for the Aqua MVP release (buybacks, NFT, etc).\n\n**Did ok:**\nManaging people - Aside from small development efforts I don’t have a lot of experience managing a full team and ensuring everyone is working on the correct tasks to maximise the efficiency of a team. So this is something I want to work on in the future. However, given that the Aqua team has kept moving with no major issues and we are very close to MVP release, I think I still did relatively well here.\nLearning - I learnt a lot from starting development work on subgraph as well as developing a more in depth knowledge of how the aqua framework works (I made an architectural diagram for docs page and my own understanding). Generally, I want to learn more about subgraph and smart contract development techniques such as how to best debug issues, and will highlight this as a key goal in my next proposal.\n\n**Improve on:**\nEthCC - When I made my previous worker proposal I didn’t even know I would be going to Paris so it was certainly a sudden decision for my first conference. It was a lot of fun and I learnt a lot, however I don’t think I did a great job of introducing people to the DAO or making connections with people. I am generally a wee bit anxious and not great at talking to new people, so this is something I want to improve on to better represent DXdao at future events (basically I need to get better at shilling).\n\n**Timeframe:**\n2 months\n\n**Compensation:**\nExperience level: 3\n\n**Time commitment**: Full time (40 hours /week)\nI’ll be away on a graduation trip with friends for 3 weekdays (29th Sep - 3rd Oct)\n\n**Salary -**\n1st month\n$6000 XDAI\n7.65 DXD in a vesting contract continuously for two years with a one year cliff\n2606.6 REP\n\n2nd month - 3 days holiday (29th-1st October)\n$5100 ($6000*0.85) XDAI\n6.5 (7.65*0.85) DXD in a vesting contract continuously for two years with a one year cliff\n2215 (2606.6*0.85) REP\n\nThis proposal falls under the current worker compensation guidelines. Should DXdao governance approve any changes to the compensation structure that could apply to work during this scope of work, the compensation amounts in this proposal may change and be reflected in the amounts requested in the final on-chain proposal.\n\nAfter this proposal I will submit a proposal to claim Eth Mainnet REP, as I haven’t yet, and currently the only REP I have is on xDai chain.\n\n**Work experience**:\n[Daotalk - Previous proposal](https://daotalk.org/t/ross-worker-proposal-18-6-2021-18-8-2021/3099)\n[Daotalk - Trial period worker proposal (Includes introduction)](https://daotalk.org/t/ross-worker-proposal-1-6-21-1-7-21/3018)\n4 years as a full stack web developer at JP Morgan\nWon polygon NFT prize at 0xHack hackathon\n\nBEGIN KEYBASE SALTPACK ENCRYPTED MESSAGE. kiNJamlTJ29ZvW4 RHAOg9hm6gzE4uw 0RR1928Ttu124SX OEtuyuxEBeVMWX0 PzCUIIEgGERjF7q 1jpPTUO5lxmLCZH 8XvBEtuxpHFtABP tKDmO6ba798S8Lz r6fE9Cgh5CDFKPx TKp01VPKjZDRS5e GGpsG5jtmyoICJH LxnaOL81hBaqX9Q TbySh9KlgJiSpvT TYopRzIAetBZmS3 GbPsNtYUkwuUJzf ul4yjYIkHd4BkZb YxIZFjhUxTVB6wY MksYhdXyhi74IZW FF3b5wpciruahIl D1ReXHtsF2Nixot ERfIBnhOxAsljPY LiY3CNwPUwxQOHF ZtAIRIb1KLCLyD8 TwAjob7j6sHOteZ NntFw06UhXuECGr 8SzA46XGXox8MPO iiVMI0o9Nt4eeMn bKkmD2UUkftQX6Q ipq01N7yHBu0yWP yapIf4pFoabTi2B kSVfCaceGHN2HkM vWJcTpqg5AM2Fsr kBg021UGOY49qjY 9SBgk6VuHmXerEu JRDH1J0MweNFemB .

[According to the most recent on-chain data and estimates](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmU1gB6iJbEgxK2BF9ugmH4LSzmwqSA934jb8Y3aieTwtk), DXD has averaged $146k over the last 3 months, so this proposal sends 10.52 WETH to the GP relayer on xDai, identified as `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`, using a [$3468.71 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum).

Due to this, for several weeks the focus was  refactoring the code to align it with the new \"standards” ( file/folder structure, unit testing, storybook, etc). I feel like our discussions and working sessions finally materialized into good results in our code. \nI think my productivity was very good, focused on DAVI project for a large amount of time, but also contributed to the dxdao contracts repo (mainly guild contracts) for the audit report issues.\n\n### Went well:  \n- The discussions about the refactor were very good. I think I was able to contribute to them. Now, after having finished a large part of the refactoring work, I see that these discussions/meetings were vital to be able to raise the level of our codebase, making it more readable, debuggable and standardized. Also (and it's not a minor thing) were very good to unite the team in technical criteria. I think we still need to improve our codebase but this was a great step.\n- I made some contributions to dxdao-contracts (guilds contracts). Personally, that was great since allowed me to be in touch with our core logic and the benefit of that was instant. I worked a lot on BaseErc20Guild contract so after that I have been able, for example, to make some fixes on proposal creation flow (voting mechanism, action calls, etc) on guilds completely sure of what is happening behind. Over time, that knowledge will naturally give me more confidence to solve bigger problems and make better decisions. I hope I can continue with it.\n- This is not something that specifically I have done well, but as a group we were able to meet in person to work with @AugustoL  and @dinocres  (dxgov team). I think that it is very important to be able to maintain this practice with some regularity, since having good relationships helps a lot with work dynamics, especially when things are not going well.\n\n### I can improve on:\n\n- In my previous period I was very excited about having integration tests setup and with the addition of the QA team I thought they would continue on that task. Maybe it was not in their priorities/plan since they are doing manual testing for now. While there isn't much I can do other than be available for when they want to get started with integration test, I think I could have done a better job by joining their weekly meetings to help speed up their process.\n- As a personal note I would add that I am still looking for the balance between the life of the dao and my work. I feel that if I pay a lot of attention to the chats/communications (in addition to my daily and meetings with the dxgov team that I attend religiously) and surely it impacts my productivity. I think this period in particular was quite productive and one of the reasons is that I didn't pay much attention to the chats. This leaves me out of many movements that are taking place, so I will continue working on that balance to be able to participate more in the dao, not because it is something I feel I must/should dom, but because it is something I want to.\n\n### Period contributions:\n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/6](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/6)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/7](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/7)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/29](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/29)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/35](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/35)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/36](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/36)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/41](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/41)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/42](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/42)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/50](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/50)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/55](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/55)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/80](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/80)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/81](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/81)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/90](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/90)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/106](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/106)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/137](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/137)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/181](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/181)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/182](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/182)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/184](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/184)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/188](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/188)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/194](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/194)  ","title":"Milton Contributor Proposal [30/05/2022 - 24/07/2022] (Part 2)","hash":"QmXskrTRTpo6Pf8W8DeC6RnXvTMbJ6dJ2WDvhZ8gc2ZC8m"},"0x4c5c48e79f0db13000d623c518f4c585683f1a457c566f67d1fee2c2fc158b19":{"description":"This proposal sends 17.53 WETH to the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions) intended to be used to place an order to purchase xDXD in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45).

I'm currently also working, and will continue to work on executing the treasury diversification proposal - and will likely submit a new one as we fill this most recent one. Part of the treasury diversification proposal also includes moving some funds into yielding protocols - which I plan to work on.\n\nI also had a chat with @AugustoL about the REP syncing issues which arise with moving to L2s. We plan to work on REP distribution analysis, to be able to quantify issued REP, locate where it was issued, and also keep track of unissued REP. We will propose a plan to manage the process of syncing REP.\n\nThe regular treasury responsibilities include the governance gas refunds, the multi-sig refunds. Ensuring our treasuries (mainly xDAI base) has enough liquidity to stay operational and keeping overall track of outflows and inflows of the treasury.\n\n**Self-Reflection:**  \nI believe I've delivered satisfactory work and done so on time. I'm happy with the positive response to the Q1 report - and am excited to start working on Q2 report.

(“Opolis”), with 475,197 $WORK coming as rewards for the contribution; 20% vested/unlocked and 80% vesting over 4 years. Future $WORK tokens that would represent 0.33% equity in Opolis, upon any sale, merger, or liquidation of Opolis at the time of the transaction. \n\n**Background** \n\nIn February 2021, DXdao community members proposed the creation of a DXdao venture arm, named DXventures. Community members adopted the idea, and DeFi projects began to contact DXdao regarding investment opportunities. Opolis approached DXdao to participate in Opolis’s Genesis Coalition as a grant investor. \n\nOpolis is a digital employment cooperative that offers independent workers fully portable benefits, payroll, and shared services. Opolis was created in order to provide contractors in the cryptocurrency space means by which to navigate the concerns that arise when handling health insurance, payroll, and tax issues while being paid in cryptocurrencies. Opolis was founded in Denver, Colorado, and currently focuses its cooperative membership services within the United States, and it also has plans to expand outside of the United States in the next one to two years.  \n\nOpolis, a Delaware corporation, is the funding and launching arm of the Employment Commons, LCA (“Commons”), a Colorado cooperative. Members can join the Commons to receive a variety of contractor-related benefits and use $WORK tokens to stake, use in governance, and hold ownership of the Commons.  \n\nOn April 26, 2021, a DXdao contributor posted a DXVentures proposal for the DXdao community to signal the approval of a $100,000 grant investment to Opolis in exchange for $WORK tokens and a warrant for future $WORK tokens in the value of 0.33% of equity in Opolis in the event of a sale, merger, or dissolution of Opolis. After some discussion and a DXD Snapshot,  the DXdao community gave signal to go forward with an onchain proposal for a $100,000 grant investment to Opolis\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAgreement for Grant Investment from DXdao to Opolis, Inc. \n(“Grant Investment Agreement”)\n\nThe following states the terms of the Grant Investment Agreement between DXdao and Opolis. \n \t \t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nUpon execution of this onchain proposal DXdao (the “Grantor”) makes a grant investment to Opolis, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Grantee”), in the amount of $100,000.00 paid in xDai stablecoins (the “Grant Investment Amount”). \n\nThis Grant Investment Amount is approved as an unrestricted gift to Grantee in furtherance of its support of the Employment Commons, LCA (the “Commons”), which aligns economic incentives among members of the Commons in support of the future of the independent, self-sovereign worker (the “Grant Investment Agreement”). \n\nThe Grant Investment Amount is provided in exchange for: \n475,197 $WORK Rewards (“$WORK Token Allocation”), to be vested into Grantor’s xDai treasury contract address 0xe716EC63C5673B3a4732D22909b38d779fa47c3F (the “xDai Address”). 20% of the $WORK Token Allocation, in the amount of 95,040 $WORK, to vest immediately upon execution of this Grant Investment Agreement, with the remaining $WORK Token Allocation to completely vest over the course, and at the conclusion, of four (4) years from the date of the execution of this Grant Investment Agreement.  \n\nIn the event of sale, liquidation, and / or merger of Grantee, Grantor shall receive a number of $WORK tokens equalling 0.33% in equity of Grantee’s assets (“Future $WORK”). The value of 0.33% equity in Grantee shall be calculated at the time of sale, liquidation, or merger of Grantee. Upon sale, liquidation, or merger of Grantee, Future $WORK shall be sent to the xDai Address. \t\nIn the event that the xDai Address no longer functions as a DXdao-approved  contract address used to hold DXdao treasury funds, a separate onchain proposal must be made to a DXdao-Approved Onchain Voting Portal to determine the appropriate Ethereum contract address for which to send Future $WORK. \n\nA DXdao-Approved Voting Portal is defined as any onchain governance portal Grantor actively uses for its onchain decentralized governance voting that manages its onchain treasury. Currently, DXdao-Approved Voting Portals include DXdao Alchemy mainnet and xDAi bases located at the following addresses: https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a; and https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f. \n\n**Conditions**:\t\n\t\t\nGrantee warrants that the Grant Investment Amount will only be used for the purposes allowed by the IRS and other government agencies relating to grants from decentralized autonomous organizations.\t\t\t\t\t\nUpon reasonable request by Grantor, Grantee shall provide updates of the progress, and / or status of objectives including how the Grant Amount was expended to attain objectives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGrantor may be eligible for warrants exchangeable for Grantee common stock subject to certain conditions and the approval of Grantee’s Board of Directors and conditioned on Grantor’s provision of certain services as a strategic ally to Grantee.\n\t\t\t\nAny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to this Grant Investment Agreement, or the breach thereof, including the issue of arbitrability, shall be exclusively settled by Kleros decentralized arbitration service (“Kleros”), under Kleros arbitration rules. The number of arbitrators shall be based on the Kleros juror selection pool model. ","title":"Proposal for Grant Investment from DXdao to Opolis, Inc.

I appreciate all the support from the community that helped me to adapt fairly well, and I’m really excited to continue my journey.\n\nTimeframe:\n\n06/09/2021 - 06/11/2021\n\nProposed scope of contribution:\n\nDXdao announcements media\nInfographics for DXdao\nSupport @zett with Swapr announcements media\nBranding for Aqua\nBranding for Project “Carrot”\nPOAP design\nOther DXdao products media\nSelf-Reflection\n\nIn my first contributor period at DXdao I worked closely with @Zett and @KeenanL throughout these months and it was a very nice experience. Design related tasks were communicated well through detailed descriptions from members of DXdao, as a result of this I was able to focus a lot of my time on design curation and less time in meetings, which was a definite plus. Overall, I really liked the process and can’t wait to crack on more tasks. Also, big thanks to @Melanie for curating my DXdao journey.\n\nOver the past two months I was working on the following:\n\nDXdao governance 2 year anniversary POAP\nSeveral Swapr banners for social media\nDXdao social media banners, such as EthCC, TheDaiost and EthLisbon\nLogo design for DXvoice\nDXdao announcement banners: Q2 treasury update and DXdocs announcement\nMultiple logo designs for the Aqua MVP\nSWPR launch and airdrop related banner designs\nImages for SWPR token Medium article\nMy timezone made it a bit tricky to schedule calls, despite this we managed to have very productive calls with the aqua team. Also, it was not the best factor for certain tasks that needed to be completed fast, however, I did my best to finish them in time.\n\nLooking forward, I think I can improve on my initiativity, communication and work more closely with DXvoice.\n\nCompensation:\n\nExperience Level 3\n\nTime commitment - 75% (30 hrs a week)\n\n$9,000 (DAI) ($4,500 * 2 months), to be sent half on the first payment proposal and half on the second payment proposal\n\n$6,000 (DXD) ($3,000 * 2 months) Vested for 2 years with a 1-year cliff\n\n4161.2 REP (2,080.6 * 2 months), to be sent half on the first payment proposal and half on the second payment proposal.\n\nWork Experience:\n\nInstagram.com/boris0xblock\n\nGraphic design contributions to Agave, Celeste, 1Hive Honeycomb and more\n\nMotion graphic design\n\nGraphic Design\n\nUI/UX Design\n\nPrevious contributor proposals:\n\n[Contributor proposal 05/07/21 - 05/09/21](https://daotalk.org/t/borisblock-contributor-proposal-05-07-21-05-09-21/3104) ","title":"Borisblock — Contributor Proposal [06/09/21 - 06/11/21]","hash":"Qmaq7qz8GryVgWszYVpH1PpRwudvU7F3ARsQxkf9nDM2CV"},"0x4fd9fc08411a92fff1810b338806529a16d5a6b548df82c6b02c1d0a0b7aeb42":{"description":"This proposal launches a HND / XDAI farming campaign that starts Wed Mar 23rd 2022 at 15:00 and ends Thu Apr 14th 2022 at 15:00; distributing 8,400 SWPR tokens and 20,000 \"Swapr GC HNDXDAI TVL 04-14\" Carrot tokens over that time period.\n\n","title":"HND / XDAI farming campaign","hash":"QmTTmMFtRqYzLbjoukr76B1aUSbmv45V4pDGrcKG71RpFJ"},"0x4fe275ae80b2662e12b938d59bab7a09e1f0e75d6929336f62a9deca1610961c":{"description":"## Timeframe:\n\n31/09/2022-31/11/2022, 2 months\n\nSorry for being late again I blame Colombia 🙈\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nSince most of October we were in Colombia, my contribution will be mostly in late October/November. Currently, Swapr direction is not determined, but as of now this is what I have discussed with Venky and Zett as my responsibilities the remainder of this period on Swapr. These responsibilities are subject to change depending on the route we choose to go with.\n\nSwapr (60%):\n\n* Add Velodrome to eco router\n* Bugs and improvements\n* Onboarding Mirko on swapr\n* Code review\n* Eco router Improvements - what I have in mind is moving aggregation of routes function to the SDK instead of how we do it now in the front-end which would make SDK much more reusable for other projects. Adam also suggested moving whole eco-routing to the serverless function which would speed up finding of routes significantly but has a trade off of being less decentralized.\n\nNimi (40%):\n\n* Features related to app and card repo\n* refactoring of app, bug fixes and new features\n\n## Self evaluation previous working period:\n\nWhat I didn’t do well:\n\n* In order to improve my front-end skills I need to dedicate less time to implementation and more time on just learning and reading\n\nWhat I did well:\n\n* I like that I'm taking on challenging tasks which I don’t have previous experience with and I definitely learned a lot by working on SDK( specifically eco router) and my knowledge on whole swapr stack is improving\n\n## Compensation\n\nI will be applying as level 5 full-time for two months.

As part of a recovery plan to try and make users whole, Agave worked with GnosisDAO and conduced an auction of AGVE token. Some contributors from DXdao engaged in due diligence of Agave to determine whether it made sense to participate in the auction. I was deeply involved with this which included discussions with Agave team members and GnosisDAO. Ultimately DXdao did not participate. Personally, I think this was good primarily because there was lack of solid funding for the Agave team and solid commitment from Agave team members.\n\n- Engaged in discussions with Karpatkey about treasury management and learned about Mimic at ETHAmsterdam when running into Facu.

We have been discussing the use of Coordinape for quite some time, and it finally came to life in the first quarter of 2022. The process was almost seamless and well adapted by DXdao contributors. I look forward to continuing the use of this DAO tool as one of the many ways to reward our active, valuable contributors.\n\nWith the big support of @violet, @nylon, @zett and @luzzifoss we were able to recruit 8 new contributors to DXdao over the past 2 months. Big thank you! It is great to see our product teams growing to help us reach our goals.\n\nWhat I can improve on:\n\nAlthough I can say ETHDenver was a success overall, there were still areas of improvement that I have identified for myself. Increased attention to detail and communication should have been given to DXdao contributors for the ETHDenver Buidlathon. This would have prevented a few hiccups during the buidler judging and award distribution phases. Despite this, I think we are in a good rhythm of planning and attending conferences/events with our community.\n\nOnboarding new contributors was a bit challenging during this period. Two main factors caused this: 1. Number of new contributors onboarding was higher than usual (a good problem to have) and 2. ETHDenver - balancing the coordination of the conference. Moving forward, I will improve strategy on how many new contributors we can support onboarding at any given time.\n\nCompensation:\n\nThis proposal falls under the new compensation structure enacted from 01/01/2022\n\n- Level 6\n- Time commitment- 100%\n- Contributing to DXdao since 3/22/2021\n-Full-time for total of 40 hours per week, for two months (4/1/2022-5/30/2022)\n\nMonth 1\n\n- $8,000 (xDAI)\n- $6,000 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n- 0.1667% REP\n\nMonth 2\n\n- $8,000 (xDAI)\n- $6,000 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n- 0.1667% REP\n- I will be attending Devconnect from April 15th-24th and requesting my Devconnect contributor stipend in my month 2 (end) proposal. Details of totals will be outlined in my reflection.\n\n\n\n","title":" Melanie Contributor Proposal 4/1/22 - 5/31/22","hash":"QmcHgBtCVjFcdbG8LSqTub1aCfAmJ9W9ctmKxufxnRUdBJ"},"0x52c344325011a5b262821327e184418f4fbc0607c288bd13584b75dfa59ffe2a":{"description":"This proposal places a 4 WETH order on CowSwap for DXD.

This proposal extends the role as a contributor into July and August.  \n\nIn the first half of July, I attended DAO Palace, a DAO Residency gathering in Germany where I spent time with 30+ others in the DAO space to discuss, research and further ideas in the DAO space.  I continually represented DXdao and helped make it stand out as a very unique org in the space. I am reducing my commitment percentage for July to 55%.\n\nI plan to continue to focus a majority of time on the DXbiz Squad revolving around business development opportunities, DXdao awareness and product awareness while contributing minority time to other initiatives as well.  I will also focus on driving initiatives forward that I think are important for DXdao, even if they sit outside of my main focus.\n\nI estimate my contribution focus to be 55% DXbiz, 10% DXvoice, 10% Governance, 5% DXventures, 20% Other/ContributorX/Product/Testing/Strategy.\n\nWhat I plan to focus on and be responsible for:\n\n**DXbiz:** I have ongoing responsibilities as the DXbiz Squad leader, which can be seen regularly in past proposals, mainly being the coordination of DXdao’s opportunities while acting as a main internal point of contact for all things related to these opportunities.  I also represent DXdao and its ecosystem at Ethereum events and in relationships with other DAOs, funds, projects, and partners.  Other related responsibilities include:\n- Coordinate the organization of and tracking of DXbiz opportunities.  Checking in with points of contact and status for each opportunity  \n- Focus on opportunities connecting DXdao and it’s products to other communities\n- Provide knowledge to Squads on the related product landscapes and strategies to take \n- Initiating, building and maintaining relationships and discussions on behalf of DXdao with external parties in the ecosystem\n- Partnerships: Develop, grow and filter partnership opportunities for DXdao\n- Bring new ideas from outside learnings to help DXdao expand its strategies across different areas.  \n- Develop, write and publish more articles about the unique and important things DXdao is leading with (creating thought leadership articles)\n- Deliver reports of actions taken and opportunity progress to the DXdao community\n- Deliver the ongoing implementation of the weekly DXbiz Huddle (and channel) where we strategize and prioritize ongoing and future opportunities.  \n- Coordinating with the product teams of DXgov, Swapr and Carrot around DXbiz opportunities in order to support the ongoing goals and grow awareness of each.\n\nAs DXdao and its products mature and evolve, we will seek out new, larger opportunities that weren’t possible previously.  This will hopefully lead to some significant achievements for DXdao.  \n\nI want to do more events like our Happy Hour in Denver and our Co-organized Happy Hour event in Paris.  I think the effectiveness of these events and the cost/benefit ratio is very attractive and also provides an opportunity for DXdao contributors to connect with and promote DXdao, its products and its ethos.  \n\nI want to do some more promotion of Carrot as v1 comes alive.  I also have an idea to change up how we are leveraging Carrot in our Swapr campaigns.  \n\n**DXvoice:** I am also a core member of the DXvoice squad, where I participate and support many of the initiatives around community, recruiting, marketing, writing articles, event, merch, design input, representing DXdao for media opportunities and at events.  \n\n**Governance:** Leading by example, I will continue to be a highly active governance participant in DXdao, including on-chain actions (review, staking, voting) and the processes and discussions that allow DXdao to remain secure and effective, proper treasury management, open discussions, and standing up for core values.  I aim to bring extra initiative to the governance processes.  I also aim to push forward the future of DXdao governance by liaising with the DXgov Squad.  One of the key values I can bring is being aware of the needs of DXdao and other DAOs.  \n\n**DXventures:** I have ongoing responsibilities as the organizer of DXventures, including filtering, presenting, organizing and driving the opportunities that DXdao has.  Completing the tasks to bring the most important opportunities to completion.  DXventures opportunities have slowed a bit recently given market conditions and the needs of new teams.  \n\n**Other/ContributorX/Product/Testing/Strategy:** I include this category to account for all other value I plan to contribute to DXdao as a core contributor.  This includes actions towards Contributor Experience, product usage, testing reporting and improvements, strategy around DXdao’s products and initiatives, helping to improve Swapr and its usage, health and awareness.  I will also be spending time helping to organize and coordinate the events that DXdao participates in.\n\n**Proposal Summary:**\nI am identifying as a Level 8 contributor, and will be applying a 55% of full commitment percentage for July 2022 and 90% of full commitment for August 2022 due to participation in DAO Palace, outside commitments, personal matters, travel and conferences. \n \n**Summary of compensation would be:**\n- 4,950 USD (9,000 x 55% plus 9,000 x 90% = 13,050) to be paid when the proposal gets approved and the balance (8,100 xDAI) on 8/30/2022 when the contribution agreement finishes. \n- Approval for: 13,775 USD (9,500 x 55% plus 9,500 x 90% = 13,775) to be paid in DXD in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff when the work agreement finishes.

This proposal places an order for 9.82 WETH using a [$4022.99 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was originally passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45), and extended for another $1m to $3m total, through a further proposal which also passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x56c66f99d87a48d707475aa2466f0a58da13bd744475410957d6572b439cc5bf). The extension on the buyback program was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/extend-dxd-buyback-program-for-another-1m-draft-proposal/3319). \n\nThis proposal would place a limit order on the Gnosis Protocol at a price that is 3% above the time-weighted average price of xDXD/WETH on Swapr when the proposal is executed and the [Oracle contract is called](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xFbAc9467FCcb14394860A9E280E2FBabCBbc8DD2/transactions).

The fact of being able to invest more time here is definitely being positive since not only I have been able to complete more tasks, but also I consider that at this point I have gained a lot of independence and can add more value.\n\n**What went well:**\n\n- Last period I worked on cypress + developer script integration. For this period one goal was to be able to perform blockchain transactions with integration tests. After some research, I discover [synpress library](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synpress), “a wrapper around cypress with metamask support” and did the implementation for dxvote (guilds) to work with our local developer script. Although along with [the implementation](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/830) I added some tests (such as approving/locking tokens and some other ui/actions tests), I think the important thing is that a good base is ready for the QA team to join and start planning a good coverage of integration tests.\n- I made 2 contributions to the smart contracts repo. Personally, any approach to **smart contracts** is a victory, not only for being able to learn more about solidity but spending more time with the contracts allows me to understand faster and make better decisions when building/fixing the front end. I hope in the next period to be able to contribute more to the SC since we will have the results of the audit available.\n- The **code reviews** went well compared to the previous period. I still need to work on the balance between all the things we could/should do here, but there was definitely an improvement in the reviews.\n- During this period I continued working on guilds adding new features and fixing some bugs. At the end of the period, the goal was to finish refactor issues and increase unit test coverage. I think that was great and also felt that all the refactor sessions that we previously had were great to be all on the same page, also contrast opinions/criteria, and were excellent as teamwork activities.\n- [Fixing eslint warnings and configuring lintstaged](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/900) was good too.\n\n**What could be improved:**\n\n- As mentioned I still need to work on the balance between code and everything else that is not related to code. I think I was too focused on my own tasks and couldn't participate or keep up with the dao. I definitely wish I could be more up-to-date and participate more (meetings, reading/voting proposals). I will continue to work on that balance.\n- Something that definitely could have been better is to spend more time covering with integration or unit tests new features that I was creating. It happened to me that after creating a new feature I had to do more than one fix later because another branch had broken the functionality. That extra effort could have been saved by adding tests the first time. I think it is a practice that should not be neglected despite feeling rushed to deliver/close a task. I consider that it does not escape the balance that I spoke about before.","title":"Milton - Contributor Proposal - [04/04/2022 - 29/05/2022]","hash":"QmenSVDyEN4SW2DJznnJ2q3wiFw9EVqx3GbEjjMdmxcK4L"},"0x55a29dfa8c8a1f494741e9ba69292d462956edccc72f749eb83a90f67b170822":{"description":"**This proposal only mints REP, I will be using devx for payment processing of stablecoins. This acts as a signal and approval for worker period and payment**\n\n**Background:\n**\nThe last worker period feels like it really flew past, moving back to Lisbon finally likely had something to do with it. We got a lot done though with a major focus on refactors that we managed to complete. The discussion and eventual splitting up our applications into DXvote-legacy and Project-DAVI is also something I am super pleased about (DXgov Q2ish Report & Update). I’m still super excited about what we have coming up soon, although it feels like there are new obstacles every day.\n\nI’ll likely be taking some time off in July after Paris as my girlfriend is back in Europe, this will of course be reflected in the second half of my payments.\n\n**Goals:\n**\n- Get the addressed code back for the final audit\n- Release guilds, leading with swpr guilds - coordinate with swapr and dxvoice\n- Social media build up educating people around what guilds solves and improves\n- Further architect data fetching in DAVI for DXdao governance (subgraph+cache)\n- Further detail and document plans for DXgov\n- Further partnerships\n- Explore storage solutions to further decentralise our ipfs/pinata reliance and support better social layer UX\n- Set a 6 month budget for DXgov\n- Hire one more senior frontend developer\n- Ensure DXvote-Legacy is more stable\n- Network in Paris and further educate about what DXdao and DXgov are building and why it is awesome\n\n**Responsibilities:\n**\n- Managing DXvote-Legacy stability and DAVI development\n- Balancing project lead responsibilities with development work (trying to reduce development while still adding value)\n- Leading DXvote calls and representing the project in DXdao calls\n- Coordinating between different teams in DXdao for guilds and feature requests, etc\n- Ensuring the team contributors are all happy, enjoying their work and reaching their potential\n- Providing a transparent look into what the DXgov team is working on and achieving\n- Managing project and sprints to ensure the team is moving forward in the most efficient and prioritised way to deliver our goals\n- Long term thinking about what DXgov will be and build\n- Taking an overall large part in the direction of DXdao\n\n**Reflection on last worker period:\n**\n\n**Did well:\n**\n- Refactoring - A major focus of this period was refactoring our new UI into something more modular and better written that could support multiple governance contracts with the same UI and great UX. We did a lot of work planning this and I am really pleased with the discussions we had as a team and the end result. We have a clear file structure, well abstracted code, unit test and even storybook.\n- Onboarding - During the last period, DXgov onboarded another developer, Dino. He has super smoothly onboarded and already is adding great value to the team. Although admittedly I cannot take all the credit for this one.\n- Documenting - Documentation of everything DXgov is doing I feel has been far better, the notion is now back in a state I am happy with and fewer conversations and decisions are being made in keybase chats.\n- Project-DAVI - Splitting up our applications into DAVI and DXvote-legacy I believe will help a lot with people’s understanding and eventual branding of DAVI into a real product. Despite being something we should maybe have done from the start I am happy we made the decision.\n- Partnerships - I have been in talks with a couple of teams both about technology we can utilise in DAVI for the social layer as well as potential users of the governance we are building, both of which will be important for DXgov.\n\n**Did ok:\n**\n- Planning - I think overall I have been putting more time into planning DXgov and steering it in the right direction but there is still so much I feel I could do here.

I managed to get better at this for a while but feel more and more like I am slipping back into working like this. Selecting a single task to work on and getting back into note-taking I think should help concentrate my mind and prevent me from context switching around a million issues.\n\n\nTimeframe: 2 months\n\nCompensation: Level 6\n\n**Salary** -\n\nI will be receiving my funds via devx the new service provider we have partnered with and as such proposals may not transfer funds as it is still being set up.\n\n1st month -\n\n$8000 DAI\n\n$6000 DXD\n\n0.1667% REP\n\n2nd month:\n\n$8000 DAI\n\n$6000 DXD\n\n0.1667% REP\n\nBEGIN KEYBASE SALTPACK SIGNED MESSAGE. kXR7VktZdyH7rvq v5weRa0zkLTK50O n6efJRAsAf1W1Na LbaPFnWlIPPTjIS 2VR42d9ihAxSnhy K7LIK0Q5cYQyZqz 1u172SeUaJ71erd t9m0oCV1YRI1DSf 741eUiWdE4oxG0O uE3E7qNGcJXaVWV kllvsDnwSTzu1KW 4vH8jOHPhUtno8I wwyBDUej54JporW wAlR9YL8tQK5OcJ WF6MCBf73YqFbqy Y4Nkmmb6J3etZv9 7TeLBo6uHWE8BaK 6bN8w3B0aO.

Contributing to DXdao has made the last two months fly by with an intensity that has made it feel like it could easily have been six months! It has been a thrilling experience and I have enjoyed it immensely. I would like to thank the many contributors that I have had the opportunity to work with during this time. I am humbled by the extent of your expertise and I truly appreciate the sharing of your knowledge and experience that has guided me during this time and helped me get situated.\n\nI have reviewed my trial period with Keenan and I am excited to say that I will be continuing my contribution to DXdao. I am also super excited to say that this will now be in a full-time capacity, now that I have negotiated an early departure from my employer.\n\nThank you all once again and as always I welcome any feedback, notes or criticism.\n\nRole:\nSocial Media and Community Growth Contributor\n\nTime frame:\n**2 Month Period - 05.04.2022 - 30.05.2022 (40 hours/week)**\nReflection on goals and responsibilities:\nWhat I think I did well in relation to my goals:\n\n1. Gradually took over existing operations/campaigns to fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities.\n\nI think that I have taken on many duties that fell within what I judged to be my scope of abilities and responsibilities. I even took on tasks that I was completely uncertain of at the outset, and even though the end product underwent many edits and changes, the experience provided valuable learning opportunities. I am happy with my contribution and progress here and think that this will greatly improve over time.\n\n2. Gained a solid understanding of the core message of the DXdao brand and of the individual product brands.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to see how decentralized DXdao is and how committed the community is to keeping it that way. I am internalizing the term “Decentralized Maximalists” and feel that it sums up the core message of DXdao. I find this message permeates every facet of DXdao and there is a constant push for all things DXdao in this general direction.\n\nLearning how to communicate as “DXdao” has also been an interesting experience and the different nuances for all of the different situations and products is also becoming clearer. Progress has been good and I will continue to focus on learning the terminology, as well as how and why things are phrased and presented a certain way. There is still plenty to learn and internalize here, but progress is satisfactory.\n\n3. Got to know the key contributors and their areas of expertise in DXdao.\n\nI have managed to introduce myself to a good many contributors, but realize there are still many I have yet to meet. I will continue to reach out and introduce myself until I have met everyone. Now that my commitment will be full time, I will have more flexibility and time to devote to this. I feel comfortable with my progress so far, because getting to know someone, especially from a distance, takes more time and a different approach. I have also come to see that even though all contributors have core competencies, they wear many hats in DXdao.\n\nI am looking forward to meeting my fellow contributors in Amsterdam.\nWhat I think I did well in relation to my responsibilities:\n\n1. Twitter Focus in accordance with:\n\n    The Social Highlights Program\n\nI think that my focus on producing quality tweets and threads was successful. I had help and guidance from Keenan, Chris and Nathan who assisted in wording and context. The Social Highlights Program is made up of more than just this and will be addressed later.\n\n    The application of the 1:10 post to engagement ratio\n\nLearning the 1:10 post to engagement ratio is moving along well, and the activity of the accounts has been vibrant.\n\n2. Social Engagement\n\nExplore DXdao history and future to assist in developing an ongoing content generating strategy to add to DXdocs and other mediums deemed acceptable by DXdao.\n\nWhile I would have liked to explore more of DXdao, I was able to assist in content generation and ended up writing two articles for Medium, as well as two for DAOtalk.\n\n3. Settling myself within Discord.\n\nThis started off slow, but picked up speed during Keenan’s absence and I am now able to arrange the weekly community calls (with the instructions provided by Keenan) and navigate the different areas of discord comfortably.\nWhat I think needs improvement:\n\nI chalk a lot of what needs improvement down to a lack of time. With my full time job during the day I found there was little time to find a window between doing what needed to be done and finding time for growth. Now that I will have the full day at my disposal, I will most certainly devote more time to shoring up these competencies:\n\n1. Twitter Focus in accordance with:\n\n    The Social Highlights Program\n\nAs previously stated, this program has much more to offer than just quality tweets and I will focus on addressing more of this program now that I am onboard full time.\n\n2. DXproduct knowledge:\n\nWhile my learning of the different products and facets of DXdao has been intensive and ongoing, and I certainly know a lot more, I personally wanted to achieve more in this area. This is very important to me and I plan to make it a priority.\n\n3. Social Engagement\n\n    Identify and analyze competitors and complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on both Twitter and Discord (ongoing).\n\nI had started to do this within the first few days of contributing, but activity picked up pretty quickly after that and the daily requirements of things that needed covering took over. Being part time gave me no window to find time to spend on this.\n\n    Help increase awareness of DXdao and its products, as well as drive social engagement with the relevant DXdao Twitter accounts through consistent and possibly even daily activity.\n\nWhile I think I have been engaged in assisting with increasing awareness of the DXdao brand by being active on Twitter, I want to have a better understanding of the DXdao ecosystem and continue to interact with it, in order to engage in a more full time, constructive and consistent manner on Twitter and Discord.\n\n4. Growth Marketing\n\n    Analyze data and track metrics of tweets to determine what is working and what is not and to optimize tweets according to target audience.\n\nWhile I glanced at metrics and basic numbers from time to time, I did not engage in much analysis. I aim to devote more time to this in the future.\n\n5. Communications\n\n    Assist with ideating and executing campaigns across owned media channels, as well as other platforms, as my awareness and knowledge grows.\n\nThis goal was a little ambitious with my limited awareness and knowledge. Until my DXdao knowledge increases this will have to be in slow motion and my contribution will be mainly in execution in collaboration with more experienced contributors. There is a lot more “listening and learning” to be done here.\nTherefore,\n\nBased on the assessment of my achievements, capabilities and what needs improvement, I think a reasonable course of action would be to leave my goal and responsibilities largely the same. There is still a large unexplored portion of the stated goals and responsibilities that I will now be able to tackle more completely as more time is available to me.\nGoals:\n\n    Improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products and services.\n    Continue clarifying existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities and take them on as my “own”.\n    Get to know the remaining key contributors that I have not yet met.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nContinue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere.\n\n    The Social Highlights Program.\n\nThere is still a large portion of this that has been left unexplored and I plan to devote more time to this.\n\n    The application of the 1:10 post to engagement ratio.\n\nSocial Engagement:\n\n    Identify and analyze competitors, complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on Twitter and Discord (ongoing.\n    Help increase awareness of DXdao and its products, drive social engagement with the relevant DXdao Twitter accounts through consistent and possibly even daily activity.\n    Explore DXdao history and future to assist in developing an ongoing content generating strategy to add to DXdocs and other mediums deemed acceptable by DXdao.\n\nGrowth Marketing:\n\n    Analyze data and track metrics of tweets to determine what is working and what is not and to optimize tweets according to target audience.\n\nCommunications:\n\n    Assist with ideating and executing campaigns across owned and other media channels as my awareness and knowledge grows.\n\nPrevious proposal:\n\n25.01.2022 - 04.04.2022: 2.5 month Trial period\nCompensation:\n\nThis compensation proposal is being submitted in accordance with the current DXdao Worker Guidelines and the current DXdao Pay Structure 1\n\nAs previously stated, I believe my past experience places me within all the levels from 1-4, primarily 3 & 4. I will be continuing my contribution at level 3 1 for this worker proposal.\n\n**In my first worker proposal I conveyed the following:\n\n“I will only be submitting my proposal for payment at the end of this working period. This is due to ongoing actions on my side regarding legal compliance with receiving payment in crypto. Until everything is set up, I cannot receive payment. It should all be completed by the end of March.”\n\nIt is taking slightly longer than expected, but there is a soft date set for Monday 04.04.2022. Then it should be a few days after that and everything will be set up for me to start receiving payment. At that time, I will submit a request for payment for the first month of this proposal as well as for the full 2.5 month trial period.**\n\nExperience Level: 3\nTOTALS:\n\nMonth one.\n\n    $5,000 (xDai)\n    $3,000 (DXD)\n    0.1667% (REP)\n\nMonth two.\n\n    $5,000 (xDai)\n    $3,000 (DXD)\n    0.1667% (REP)\n\nThe full 2 month period.\n\n    $10,000 (xDai)\n    $6,000 (DXD) to be paid in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff when the work agreement finishes.

During this time, I assisted with organizing and collaborating with others to plan the events that occurred throughout the weeks we were there. As always, it was amazing to see everyone from DXdao and members of the Ethereum community! A personal highlight of mine was representing DXdao and hosting a workshop at Devcon 6 that focused on the Contributor Experience, Building the Builders: How You Can Create the Next Generation of Web3 Contributors through Education, Peer Review, and Professional Development. It was great to discuss the Contributor Experience with those others interested in the space.\n\nAs outlined in my proposal, I began to shift attention this period toward recruiting. @AugustoL and I worked together to develop a process that would help us streamline the recruitment of Senior Solidity developers to DXdao. At the moment, we are recruiting a Senior Solidity developer for DXdao. Thus far, we have sourced and interviewed quite a few applicants. We are narrowing down our selection, and I feel confident we will onboard a contributor who can fill this role in the upcoming weeks.\n\nDuring this period, I also collaborated with @ross and @whatt4 on testing for Guilds, and we successfully sent all of the Infinite prizes from the DevOps Guild to our hacker winners. DAVI is pretty awesome!\n\n**What went okay**\n\nIn November we faced quite a few challenges with the contributor proposal process. Mainly because Alchemy went offline and contributors who normally used Alchemy to submit their proposals had to transition to solely using DXvote. Unfortunately, due to this I had to dedicate more time than expected to individually supporting contributors through this process on DXvote.\n\nI will be claiming funds in this proposal in addition to my compensation. They are for DAVI testing, the txns can be found below, as well as payments I made for the Inifinte hackathon.\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x608b4454b0138cf54fc289f711a7ae1e596131c6aefb9335ae227b75b789a555 $9.22\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x5b2231f9b9cde5359d957b6f5de9ce9784882c36537eb039f0fd6d450d613e2f 23.07\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x6fd5cf3be9263e55c7d14c849635d554d0fcb50d84578dfd59549193d34c09eb $1.77\n\nInfinite Hackathon Expenses\n\n- Banners: $525.58\n- Infinite Stickers: $69.25\n- Wristbands: $230.30","title":"​ Melanie Contributor Proposal 10/1/2022-11/30/2022 - END","hash":"QmNspRDQcwSQFzBNVDYuBYqtUemXZVwBfnohaWwbaYRH5i"},"0x56904232af3c2908b040d6c7f3990ec96017553b16b13b81f65e41f9d332ef5d":{"description":"xDXD Buyback Order #227 for 8.37 WETH\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

It will document their visions, objectives, and responsibilities, contributor roles and compensation, as well as other pertinent expenses to be reviewed and approved by the DAO as a whole.\n\n## Guild Structure\n\nNetworks: Ethereum, Gnosis Chain\n\nPlatform: DAVI Soulbound\n\nGuild governance members:\n\n|Entity|Soulbound %|Address|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Ross|20%|rossdev.eth|\n|Augusto|20%|augustol.eth|\n|Madusha|20%|madusha.eth|\n|Milton|17%|miltor.eth|\n|Kenny|13%|vangrim.eth|\n|Dino|9%|dinocres.eth|\n|Tomas|3%|pulen.eth|\n\nGovernance Rules:\n\n* Cannot earn additional governance power past 30%\n* One month of full-time contributions to Operations guild earns 1% of soulbound governance power in the Operations Guild (rounded down value of what 1 month represents in the initial distribution)\n* Need 2% to submit a proposal\n* Initial distribution based on time in DXgov which was founded in Sep/21\n* Monthly rep distribution will be done in one proposal to eliminate gaming the system by delaying rep mints\n\n## Vision and Mission\n\nDXgov is responsible for the development and maintenance of DXdao’s governance platforms and products. Originally this only meant building and improving DXdao’s own governance, however it has since evolved into a product for others after receiving feedback and demand for our take on governance.\n\nThe current contracts; guilds and gov 1.5 (the forked governance architecture from daostack) make up the majority of the smart contract work.\n\nWe are building Project DAVI as an interface and product that supports both of the systems mentioned above in a flexible front end aimed at improving the UX of autonomous on-chain DAOs like ourselves.\n\nDXdao’s restructuring and discussions at the 2022 retreat set out a new vision for DXdao: “Enable community freedom” this has also impacted DAVI’s place in DXdao and scope of work. We had already been exploring more advanced features beyond simple governance such as integrating a social layer tightly coupled to governance decisions and discussion. However, this vision and direction also identified DAVI as a more core interface to bring communities more power and access to our ecosystem.\n\nThe priority for this period remains on core DXdao governance work but will also begin further exploring how DAVI fits into what DXdao is building and how we can enable community freedom.\n\n## Overall Guild Milestones and goals\n\n* Governance 1.5 supported by DAVI (DXdao able to begin the transition to new contracts)\n* Rich contracts 2.0 - New UX for proposal decoding and encoding\n* Social MVP complete\n\n* Governance 2.0 Voting machine complete and off to audit\n* DAVI ready to support the upgrade from 1.5→2.0\n* Social v1 complete\n\n### Longer term goals\n\nThe idea identified in phase 2 of restructuring with DAVI being the central interface to the DXdao ecosystem. This would require UX improvements that give DAVI DAOs features not found in any other DAO interface (DAO-DAO voting, social integration, non-technical governance, accessible autonomy, etc). However, the ecosystem aspect would require a lot more features to be developed with far more integrations between squads. And since this UX would be core to the DXdao ecosystem and other products would be dependent on DAVI onboarding DAOs (users) and giving those DAOs good support, more resources would be required. The scope of the application would increase as DAVI would become not just the main way DAOs operate but the main way to use DXdao’s products.\n\nThe ecosystem approach has been identified as the direction of DXdao in the phase 2 proposal but details are yet to be decided. To build DAVI into what it will be beyond just DXdao close collaboration between all squads will be essential.

Also updated accuracy of stipend calculations and added gas costs as a contingency for deployments.\n\n\nSome notes: \n- \"Development contractors\" under \"other costs\" is a budget specifically for features which are more efficiently implemented by outside resources, an example would be parallax developing our orbis social integration. It is also the intent of DXgov to have standing bounties for specific standalone features which would benefit DXgov and DAVI greatly but are not currently prioritised for contributor resources. \n- For the budgets generally, QA has been planned as a separate resource and so was included under \"other costs\" \n- Level increases were included under \"other costs\" as contingencies which would be posted publically in the DXdao general forum for comment and approval\n\nAnd a comparison to a year ago for these same squads:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-11-30 at 19.12.26|690x150](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/daostack/original/2X/6/629d5b1c8e3012ce81fa40038af0db39a96fc6f6.jpeg)\n\n## Squad Metrics\n\n### Objective: Improve DXdao’s governance system\n\n**KR1:** Governance 2.0 contracts should be implemented with full tests\n\n**KR2:** Governance 2.0 contracts should be sent away for audit\n\n### Objective: Support multiple governance systems in DAVI\n\n**KR1**: Have a Gov >1.5 (forked daostack architecture) DAO working in DAVI production\n\n(The distinction of 1.5 and 2.0 is small in terms of the UI and will depend on the operational speed of supporting 2.0)\n\n**KR2:** Explore, publish research and if decided important begin support for more governance systems in DAVI\n\n### Objective: Bring external communities into DAVI\n\n**KR1:** Onboard at least 1 external communities onto DAVI\n\n**KR2:** Write and maintain non-technical documentation\n\n**KR3:** Release a DAO launcher UI in DAVI\n\n### Objective: Provide the best DAO UX in the space\n\n**KR1:** Implement v2 of rich contract data (a key UX system in DAVI)\n\n**KR2:** Integrate the social aspect of governance (currently a forum) inside DAVI\n\n**KR3:** Conduct user surveys that aim to answer whether non-technical users can utilise autonomy in DAVI DAOs\n\n### Objective: Support DXdao ecosystem\n\n**KR1:** Identify, communicate and work with other development guilds on potential integrations with DAVI\n\n**KR2:** Support at least one integration to another DXdao product (action in DAVI proposal builder)\n\n**KR3:** DAVI should be used by DXdao contributors almost daily as their main governance interface\n\n(partially dependent on operational speed of moving main DXdao DAO to new contracts)\n\n### Responsibilities\n\n* Supporting DAVI\n* Maintaining operatable DXvote until it is no longer in use\n* Educating about DAVI and governance systems\n* Facilitating discussions on DAVI integrations\n* Deploying new guilds and DAO contracts\n* Regularly releasing new stable versions of DAVI\n* Alongside other squads, help plan what DAVI will look like inside the DXdao ecosystem as a key interface\n\n## Guild Personnel\n\nIndividual contributor lists, contributor level information per[ approved guidelines](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xaa3c6d9953d5510a0f014f946e94f03f07a4e5259718e86f07d41d255917e410), and time commitment as a percentage of full time.\n\n|Contributor|Level|Time Commitment|Description of Role|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Ross|Level 6|40 hrs/week|Lead, DAVI architecture and occasional dev|\n|Augusto|Level 8|10 hrs/week for first 3 months|Smart contract lead|\n|Madusha|Level 5|40 hrs/week|DAVI architecture and dev|\n|Milton|Level 5|40 hrs/week|DAVI and smart contract developer|\n|Kenny|Level 4|32-40 hrs/week|DAVI dev and leads retro sessions|\n|Dino|Level 3|40 hrs/week|DAVI dev|\n|Tomas|Level 2|30 hrs/week|DAVI dev|\n|Boris|Level 4|20 hrs/week|DAVI designer|\n|Totals||252 hrs/week||\n","title":"Approve DXgov Guild H1 2023 Budget Proposal","hash":"QmfMgMvktaNA4CqcbzRCxJLKz3cMMjLRPZJ4RqchFmmTVA"},"0x56c66f99d87a48d707475aa2466f0a58da13bd744475410957d6572b439cc5bf":{"description":"\nBelow is a proposal that would extend the DXD Buyback Program by another $1m to $3m total. This was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/extend-dxd-buyback-program-for-another-1m-draft-proposal/3319).\n\n## Background\n\nThe [DXD Buyback Program](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) was passed by REP holders in May of this year. Since then, 5,230 DXD have been purchased on mainnet and xDai for an [average price of 0.144 ETH/DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing). Using the USD price at the time of purchase, $1.9m of DXD has been purchased. This is just over 10% of the DXD circulating supply. \n\nThe [buyback program was updated](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xd6c4bfd03d87c365432c073ff0f36578c3cba9da080b75de5058357319908039) in June to increase the slippage tolerance of trades as well as clarify the accounting measures. The[ buyback program was then extended](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x6f4bb1bb12469639b4af6f67ee04b174b07df211b3de45e6254de65082446af0) for another $1m. The total amount of DXD purchased is quickly approaching the limit placed on it by the previous proposal and soft community consensus has demonstrated support for another $1m extension.\n\nAccounting for the 5,230 DXD repurchased, the outstanding DXD represents a market cap of $24.1m - still comfortably below the [$46m in ETH in the DXdao treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) and [the $8m in the buyback reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521). The buyback program is intended to address this discrepancy and acquire an undervalued asset.\n\nThe [proposed DXD token model ](https://daotalk.org/t/proposed-dxd-token-model/2898)that has been embraced by the community intends to upgrade the DXD bonding curve and shift to a different buyback method for DXD. While the community moves toward a new model, the methods outlined in the DXD Buyback Program and purchases through the [GP Relayer](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmd8TCEr6syKxAnmuBH3hsyvxfSgRJgANLTTorp3JGZY77) on xDai and Mainnet enable DXdao to drive value to DXD holders now. \n\n## Details\n\nThis proposal extends the DXD Buyback Program for another $1m to $3m total under the same conditions outlined in the original [Buyback Program signal proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af5), [the parameter update](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xd6c4bfd03d87c365432c073ff0f36578c3cba9da080b75de5058357319908039) and the [first extension](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x6f4bb1bb12469639b4af6f67ee04b174b07df211b3de45e6254de65082446af0). This proposal further stipulates that DXD or xDXD in the GP Relayer does not contribute to the count of DXD circulating supply.\n\nThese and other DXD purchases through the Buyback Program have contributed to the community’s intention to use the buyback reserve to purchase DXD. ETH from [DXdao’s general treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) can be used in lieu of the buyback reserve until the DXD token contract is upgraded and that ETH is recovered. In total, the [buyback reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521) has 2,499 ETH and so far, 756 ETH has been used to purchase the 5,230 DXD purchased through the buyback program.\n\n## Risks and considerations\n\nThe program will take place on xDai, a sidechain with less security properties than Ethereum. The Buyback Program has been running for four months with few problems; the GP Relayer has worked to complete the purchases at the market price. There is a concern that Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai will have limited support, but DXdao community members are striving to maintain the network of solvers.\n\nDXdao has already spent almost $2m repurchasing DXD. This has increased the price of DXD relative to ETH but it still falls below the book value of ETH in the treasury.","title":"Extend DXD Buyback Program for another $1m","hash":"QmZxDRUF2Kqoi6X6E6j8Rxz92oz7MCKURmaYSCeqah6WYM"},"0x5715b4637b8e32cf3f44dac8fbd78f38a87fc1563e5957e4eecbdd5723a03450":{"description":"**Hi All,**\n\nAmsterdam was a fantastic experience and a tremendous growth opportunity.

I know that I mention this on all of my worker proposals, so I will not go into detail here, but I just can’t help saying that it is still an amazing experience to me, this “time” thing in web3.\n\nWith DEVCon around the corner, I am very excited to see everyone again (and to meet the few people I have not yet met), to attend the Infinite Hackathon and to get to spend some more personal time with everyone in Cartagena. It is really going to be great, and as we get closer to the date it seems that ETH Bogotá is going to be BIG. Momentum is building and I can see it on the feeds, chats and channels.\n\nWith nearly every DXdao contributor descending on ETH Bogotá, we’ll be a force to be reckoned with, and with Nimi in our midst, I am super excited. To side-track a little, I really love Nimi and think it is an awesome product and idea. I love using my Nimi profile. It was so funny to see the recent tweets from the Nimi account of Dave with the bag over his head and Adam the Boss sitting pounding away at that Mac. They were awesome!\n\nI mentioned it in my last proposal, but I think it is worth repeating. DXdao’s contributors are an amazing group of individuals. I feel privileged to be around you all and to have this opportunity to learn from you.\n\nThank you all once again and as always, I welcome any feedback, notes or criticism.\n\n**Role:**\nSocial Media and Community Growth Contributor\n**Time frame:**\n2 Month Period - 26.09.2022 - 25.11.2022 (40 hours/week)\n\n## Reflection on goals and responsibilities:\n**What I think I did well in relation to my goals:**\n*Improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products\n*\nAs stated before this is my favorite objective and, even though this is a moving target, I am still 100% committed to this and adding to my knowledge all the time. I realized now when I was attending ETHWarsaw that I could draw on information about Swapr and Carrot without trouble and present it in a way that is both understandable to the recipients, as well as flattering to the product and the team building it. This was a great realization after I received my first “So what makes your DEX/AMM different from all the other ones on the market?” and “so what does DXdao do?”. FYI, when asked what DXdao does, I said “we grow Carrots and take care of Monsters” - people loved that answer, especially when I went on to explain the products behind that cheeky answer.\n\n*Continue clarifying existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities and take them on as my “own”.*\n\nTaking responsibility for the areas that one would deem fall under my purview has always been one of my primary objectives and one that I take very seriously. Organizations usually fill positions for two reasons. One, the need to have the work done and two, to alleviate the stress and workload of existing personnel who are currently fulfilling those obligations. It was therefore paramount that I clearly identify and take over these responsibilities. In my assessment, based on the feedback from my peers, this goal has been achieved. Since it is an ongoing activity, I will remain vigilant in maintaining this level of commitment and output.\n\n*Get to know the remaining key contributors that I have not yet met.*\n\nParis was a wonderful opportunity to meet all the contributors that I had not yet met. Specifically @KeenanL and @international.blue with whom I work closely on a regular basis. Personal contact is truly important for fostering sound working relationships, I am REALLY looking forward to seeing the “whole” of DXdao. It seems that we will be short only one or two contributors who won’t be attending, so it is bound to be an amazing experience.\n\nI would add that I do not think it a bad idea for us to have occasional calls with our cameras on, for two reasons: visual representation of what we are saying helps with communication, and it usually does not extend meetings beyond their point of usefulness keeping meeting short and sweet. Either way, just a thought.\n\n**What I think I did well in relation to my Responsibilities:**\n*Continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere:*\n\nI do not see this changing as a focal point for me as this plays a major role in DXdao’s communications and notification structure. It is also the primary reason I was taken on by the DAO and I must say that I am very happy with how things are going here. As the needs of the DAO become clearer and my knowledge expands, I am able to deliver better and more consistently. This is my favorite part of the work (other than meeting you all at conferences that is), and I look forward to expanding and growing here.\n\nI continue to make a point of focusing on the 1:10 post to engagement ratio and actively seek out mentions and content related to the DAO, its products and contributors. This engagement is also increasing in quality as my knowledge of DXdao and the ecosystem has grown.\n\n*Communications:*\n\nAs I stated in my previous proposal, creating content for DXdao on a more consistent basis was a personal objective of mine. I made it a point during this proposal to help in the content creation and was very happy to be a part of a lot of the work that went out over the past two months. There are even some articles in backlog waiting for the right time to be published. With ETH Bogota coming up, front-run by Infinite, I can only imagine all the juicy bits and pieces I will be able to gather and put together. It is bound to be great! Please wear your “Do Not Photograph” sticker around me at all times if you do not want photos taken and if you go on stage, well then I have to say that it’s fair game.\n\n**What I think needs improvement in relation to my Responsibilities**\n*Time Management:*\nI am still spending 10-12 hours a day, Monday to Friday, with a few hours each on Saturdays and Sundays sitting in front of the computer. I mentioned in my last proposal that I have built up this habit and while I do go to sleep slightly earlier, this has only slightly improved. I need to pay more attention to this and will continue to focus on this over the next two months to make sure I remain productive. Right now it does not seem like burn-out can affect me, but I have been warned to be careful. Thank you to those of you who have cautioned me of this.\n\n*Social Engagement:*\nIn the past I have always made it a priority to highlight our contributors’ engagement with the greater web3 community. Be it on stage, on Twitter or a podcast. I think this is very important and good for the DAO on many levels. It highlights to the outside world that we support our contributors and their actions while representing the DAO. It shows our contributors that we as a community support and value them and lastly, it always gives me an opportunity to learn more about the DAO, about the person presenting and the space in general.\n\nWith everything leading up to ETH Paris and shortly after, time was in short supply and I was not able to highlight three events. We had a multitude of other initiatives and announcements that kept taking precedence over these and because I did not plan time allocations for unexpected events, I found myself unable to get them out. I am not happy about this for the professional reasons above and for personal reasons.\n\nThis needs attention and I will say that I have established a new routine that allows for allotting time to “unexpected events” when I know there have been appearances from contributors. Murphy’s law, I was recently presented with similar conditions to the time surrounding ETH Paris, so it was a great time to test this new routine. While there was a little pressure, I still had available time and I was able to push out the work I wanted to get out. I hope to see continued and increased success with this in the future.\n\n## Goals:\n\n1. Continue to improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products and services.\n\n2. Maintain existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities.\n\n3. Continue to contribute to the DXvoice squad in a flexible manner which adds value to the squad and to the greater DAO.\n\n## Responsibilities:\nContinue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere.\n\n- Devise relevant Twitter Campaigns with relevant parties.\n- Maintain a constant information stream relevant to the product and its users.\n\nSocial Engagement:\n\n- Help increase awareness of DXdao and its products, and drive social engagement with the relevant DXdao Twitter accounts.\n- Continue to assist in generating content supporting the activities of the DAO to add to the relevant mediums deemed acceptable by DXdao.\n- Identify and analyze competitors, complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on Twitter and Discord.\n\nGrowth Marketing:\n\n- Analyze data and track metrics of tweets to determine what is working, what is not, and to optimize tweets according to the target audience.\n\nCommunications:\n\n- Assist with ideating and executing campaigns across owned and other media channels, as needed.\n\n**Previous proposals:**\n[25.01.2022 - 04.04.2022: 2.5 month Trial period](https://daotalk.org/t/waynes-worker-proposal-trial-period-late-jan-2022-to-early-april-2022/3939/5)\n[05.04.2022 - 30.05.2022](https://daotalk.org/t/waynes-worker-proposal-early-april-2022-late-may-2022/4029#what-i-think-needs-improvement-5)\n[31.05.2022 - 25.07.2022](https://daotalk.org/t/waynes-worker-proposal-early-june-2022-late-july-2022/4205)\n[26.07.2022 - 25.09.2022](https://daotalk.org/t/wayne-s-worker-proposal-late-july-2022-late-sep-2022/4358)\n\n### Compensation:\nThis compensation proposal is being submitted in accordance with the current [DXdao Worker Guidelines](https://dxdocs.eth.limo/docs/ContributorHub/contributor-onboarding/) and the current [DXdao Pay Structure](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/xdai/proposal/0xd891621300fb5cd46a7962787f4d2fa85998bfb5524aae4b1784a620c562fdae)\n\nExperience Level: 4\n\n**Month one.**\n\n$6,000 (6000xDAI)\n$4,000 (DXD)\n0.1667% (REP)\n\n**Month two.**\n\n$6,000 (6000xDAI)\n$4,000 (DXD)\n0.1667% (REP)\n\n**The full 2 month period.**\n$12,000 (xDAI)\n$8,000 (DXD) to be paid in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff.\n0.3334% (REP) To be claimed at the end of this worker proposal.\n\nMonth one to be paid with the passing of this proposal. \n\n**These services are provided through DevX AG.**\n\nBEGIN KEYBASE SALTPACK SIGNED MESSAGE. kXR7VktZdyH7rvq v5weRa0zkTNDAA9 RYLoFmcXHaJ1rG7 Mux3x6QsApUPNO3 TeGBR1XxFt9UWJu S1q248AbzxpiNNG 067ePShmuT8S6Qc HWNrZf0LwieHkWF wI6WmBQOQG46NIF tBGA5QgGDeeapiV X0NfJ9WrnGNDj3e O8wycuF04ycpY5m 6PWy9JCsN3by8A5 H6x6mvZbBxPuTTL 0miG.

Thank you for improvements and great proposals. Work on automation is not fast enough ‘cause we have a lot of PR’s that need to be tested, I think that’s priority so far because of preparation for launch to PROD. First step for improvement is to have a Smoke test ready in the pipeline which will be triggered on every merge to develop branch. Work a lot on Regression testing on release branches and communicate using a clear issue list.\n\nSpent a great time in Bogota and nice to meet you all !!!\n\n  - Successful constant testing and retesting of PRs. I tried to describe the bugs or strange behavior as well as possible so that the devs could understand and find solution to improve the state\n  - Improving FTC (Test Scenarios, Test Cases and HappyPath) so that they can be ready for automation tests but also for onboarding new members who would pass the manual testing according to the instructions from these documents and get to know better all the possibilities and features of Guilds\n  - Retrospective of the QA work done so far in order to look back on what has been done and consider how we can improve the work done so far and improve the work process even more\n  - Start with automation and working still on LOCAL, plan to push when Smoke test will be ready for the first stage\n\nImproved my understanding of Guilds and changed my approach in some specific cases. Need to work more on application knowledge and going deeply with it.\n\nI understand the values ​​of being a member of a DXdao and remaining self-motivated, disciplined, and consistent in my work. Working at DXdao makes contributors not only better in the technical field or DeFi experts, but also better people who work on themselves in every field and “fight” with themselves to achieve the same goal of decentralization. \n\n**Improvements:**\n\nI was focused on contributing to Guilds as soon as possible and “serving a purpose” as a QA Engineer as much as I can for this trial period I haven’t had that much time to learn and get to know more about DXdao in general and other projects mentioned in the weekly meetings, so my goal is to improve to benefit the community and beyond the Guilds project but to continue to contribute to Guilds as needed and more.\nMore focus on application knowledge, attend more meetings and discussions, work more on QA framework after completion of testing PR’s, better understanding of low level application and communication with smart contracts.\n\n**Proof of work:**\n\n#233 -

It was also nice receiving some good feedback on the format we handed it back to them in - [read here](https://rossneilson.notion.site/Sigma-Prime-Guilds-Audit-Fixes-145724bb627c4eab94cf285552f2c128). Obviously, this directly blocks the release of guilds since we don't have the report back yet.\n* **DXD guild -** Although the [post](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-voting-power-guilds-2-0/4467) only went up recently a lot of time was put into the article to bring the idea of a DXD guild to DXD holders. I’m hopeful this will provide a meaningful way for DXD holders to voice and enact their opinions in an autonomous way.\n* **Documentation/Planning -** Still really just a start but I ended up using [DXgov’s notion](https://rossneilson.notion.site/DXgov-c1655a56255b4ad78d05162c634b0634) a lot more this period with a total of 12 new posts covering documentation and planning. I still dont think many people read this but it is at least for me a better way of getting ideas onto paper and collecting them into one place. I did also advertise a few in general chats to get thoughts. In particular, I was very happy with some of the planning I got onto paper around [DAVI revenue](https://rossneilson.notion.site/Governance-Revenue-generation-a806c15aca364fd8a4fb2cf61ca75ba4)\n* **Budget -** I took quite a good amount of time looking at DXgov’s budget and I think the work done should help much better give an idea of where DXdao is investing resources. Coming out relatively small in comparison was nice to see and I think we are managing to do some pretty great work considering our budget. The forward-looking budget was made trying to be realistic but also limiting expansion due to market conditions.\n* **QA -** QA’s role in DXgov is growing and I cant really take much credit as it has been Phillip and Milan putting in the work but it is great to see the processes grow and I am sure having QA will greatly increase the quality of DAVI.\n* **DXgov team -** Although this isn't pointing to anything directly nor is it even something I can take all or anything near all the credit for, the team has been working SUPER well recently. We have been crushing each sprint, increasing story points completed, improving processes, devs working on smart contracts and getting very close to being able to show you all our hard work.\n* **Took a holiday! -** I think I have done a pretty good job handling work life balance and taking breaks recently and have been really happy with the results. I find myself more efficient with my time and very far from burnout.\n\n**Did ok:**\n\n* **DAVI’s place in DXgov and DXdao -** I think I am now at the point where I have a solid understanding of what DAVI is and what it can be. But the reason this is just ok is that everyone needs to understand this and right now I think everything DXgov is working on is still pretty confusing. I hope to fix this once we get branding of DAVI sorted, can put out more articles and get the app into people’s hands.\n\n* **Partnerships -** We got a connection to a couple of more teams interested in what we are building so continuing to build out those relationships and future integrations. In addition, followed up with some previous connections. Having DAVI live should help with demos and actually getting people on board.\n* **IPFS solutions -** I developed a small tool (https://github.com/DXgovernance/ipfs-cluster-propagator) for us to propagate our own IPFS data across DAO contributors. As an initial proof of concept, I think it is pretty awesome and a good way for us to utilise decentralised hardware to benefit the DAO. But it needs more people to use it, so still a work in progress. As a side note with the help of Federico and Madusha we have come up with a super awesome concept for a v2 :eyes:\n* **DXdao 1.5 -** We are making big progress towards the contracts being ready for a new parallel DXdao deployment but I didn’t get to spend as much time as I wanted planning out how we are going to handle things on the DAVI side. With how timelines are now I think it is likely we will go with a simple subgraph and tackle the backup cache architecture later.\n\n**Could have done better:**\n\n* **Writing -** I had a bunch of help on the DXD guild article and I am so grateful for that. But I also really want to work more on my own writing style and improve on how I go about polishing the pieces. I think I tend to write in a very personal style and I dont think it works for more structured pieces like this.\n\n**Holiday update**\n\nI just realised I did not take holidays off of my compensation and so am recreating this on chain.\n\nAlthough not requesting stablecoins since I am doing this through DevX I will recreate it to give the correct REP and signal the stablecoin transfer that will come after. \n\n4 days unpaid holiday taken after EthCC = 26/30 days = 86% of original compensation\n\n8000*0.86 = $6880 in stables\n\n6000*0.86 = $6880 in DXD\n\n3115 REP received in original proposal * 0.86 = 2678 REP","title":"Ross Neilson Worker Proposal 18/6/2022-18/8/2022 2/2 With holidays","hash":"QmQ788rvQpM8AsEoWuuaRSfbYuJD2m8rvqn9jGXKn7PoTn"},"0x5b5eb0ce2852e1bc79bcf7bada2ab9998961b700755843b137e74aa109e8c51d":{"description":"\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

What holding me back was first not having the legal entity ready, but that's now in place for 2 months.\n\nEnd of May I worked 6 months for the DXdao. I was quite euphoric at the start and learned a lot during this time.\n\nWhat I have achieved, thanks to the mesa team. \n\n- I was able to bootstrap a new product from scratch by assembling a team, mostly by myself, except nico/sky, to develop a vision and execute on this vision.\n- We built a framework for IDOs which is adaptive and can be a neutral platform for a range of needs.\n- Mesa has the potantial to grow in different directions and has a solid, but flexible architecture.\n- Software quality is good in the sens that we have a high test coverage and can replicate development environment fully of-chain with all component, this allows us to innovate/adapt quickly.\n\n\n\n**My goal is to bring Mesa as close as possible to this**:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cncol7d.png)\n\nScroll down to see the reality of building products [:arrow_down:](#Reality-of-building-a-product)\n\n\n# Nov/December 2020 \n\nFirst Working Proposal, 1 month,  24.11 - 24.12\n\nhttps://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-martin-krung-24-11-24-12/2363\n\n\n## Responsibilities (from my first proposal)\n\nProduct Owner/Manager for Mesa\nCoordination work on Mesa UX with devs/UX Design\nProvide feedback for Mesa on the gitcoin hackathon https://github.com/dxdaohackathon/dex-react/issues/1\nCoordination with gnosis about further development gnosis protocol\nEmbed Mesa in an overall product strategy\nConsult on projects doing IDO\nCollect feedback from projects doing IDOs and end-user\nReporting back to DXdao\nResearch on competing protocols\nTake part in bizDev\nOn-board new workers for mesa IDO\n\n##  Reflection about Responsibilities \n\nMy responsibilities are mostly still the same. I will adjust this in my formal forward-looking proposal. (Which will start 1. June, link to new proposal)\n\n\n## Goals this month (Nov/December 2020)\n\nFrom my first proposal: https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-martin-krung-24-11-24-12/2363\n\n## Reflection about the **Goals this month** \n\n\n### Develop a strategy/roadmap for Mesa IDO \n\n* Mesa Roadmap December 2020: https://hackmd.io/v8eO2cGhTCWD0YhjeGYXYg\n* Schedule, December 2020:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=1158278892\n* Mesa Roadmap as Chart, December 2020: https://www.figma.com/file/yL8VJ1KR0pzlEx6NXIUeQD/Mesa-Architecture?node-id=0%3A1\n\n\n### Make personas and user stories for Mesa IDO \n\n(Not formally done, but my talk with several possible clients and thinking at my experience on the investor side)\n\n* I talked to thomas from artis/minerva, learning there: it may be worth to have a mobile wallet like minerva to give noobs the opportunity to invest. (Reduce fiat to crypto friction, but checking today, even minerva, who has done a sale on gnosis auction/xdai managed not to make a wallet version for this)\n \n* Bodgan of Stater -> learning there: Many projects already have a free tradable token and make their first public sales later. (Also Minerva)\n\n\n## Find an agreement with gnosis about responsibilities in the future (we agree to not agree)  \n\n\n* Gnosis forum entry: https://forum.gnosis.io/t/dxdao-x-gnosisdao-partnership-discussion/905\n* Proposal draft (shared with gnosis): https://hackmd.io/hAtiuLS4RAe40jBqf6dY8Q\n* Variation of possible solutions (My note): https://hackmd.io/2Tv1OzGMRtChwa5VDmbd4w\n\n(No feedback from gnosis, talks later also not lead to any deal)\n\n## Start adaption for Mesa IDO frontend\n\n* Geromimo made a minimal draft and this helped us big to kick off things. Adam implemented a first version of this.\n\n\n## Start of standardization of Service for IDO Projects\n\nThis also helped me to think about who are our costumers:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=671031870\n\nGenerally speaking, my first month set the stage, and we are still executing this.\n\n\n### Other things I worked on\n\n* Analyze different token sale mechanics: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=485683229\n\n\n\n## Long Term/More\n\nFrom my first proposal: https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-martin-krung-24-11-24-12/2363\n\n###  Establish agile project management for Mesa IDO\n\nWe have been doing this, Venky helped me. We have a daily call, which is time-boxed to 15 min, and we have a weekly show and tell call on Monday. We are not doing pure agile, the team is not mature enough.\n\n###  Start a weekly 1h mesa IDO call \n\nI do this every Wednesday. Mostly I do some research what's happening on the market with other IDO project or ongoing sales, we discuss strategy and do some refinement.\n\nSheet with all the calls I made:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=795583827\n\n\n### Take over Mesa deployment from LevelK\n\nNothing to do, old Mesa is defunct now.\n\n### Enhance Documentation for Mesa IDO\n\nWe started a gitbook lately: https://mesa-1.gitbook.io/mesa/\n\nIn general, I did write some things, but after very limited feedback I decide that writing down things does not move the project forward.\n\n### Spread the word about DXdao over my personal twitter account\n\nI do, from time to time, also use it as the main tool for recruiting new members.\n\n### Helping research/develop new products\n\nWe have to finish the 3 products we got, no need for this and if, not my focus right now.\n\n### Help to develop a vision for DXdao\n\nNo time for this, even I think it's still needed.\n\n### Help with decentralized infrastructure research/testing\n\nNo time for this, we use the graph and may be radical but don't run hardware. I guess I mostly wrote this because I have some DevOps skills, running web server for 20y.\n\n### Start to learn smart contract development\n\nI did implement some features (in March) and I have a working environment for this now. I understand even better how smart contract work and what the limits are. I started working as a dev to support the team, to understand pain points and to do some research on a next-generation sale mechanism.\n\nhttps://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts/commits/feature/distributeAllTokens-for-FairSale\nhttps://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts/commits/feature/pointdutch-with-off-chain-sp\n\nOther work in December:\n\nSetup of https://snapshot.page/ for DXdao: https://hackmd.io/Wvj_SUfaRMC8p2D9uo2RHA\n\n\n\n# Further work\n\n\nAs I did not do a proposal after my first one, I started to work with giving every month a focus/topic. This is not how this should work, but my commitment and responsibility stayed the same.\n\nOn the tech side best is to visit my github profile: \n\nhttps://github.com/martinkrung\n \n \n# January 2021 / recruiting\n\n## Facts\n\n- Adam started in the second week of February \n- Recruiting calls with ~10 person\n- Help them to onboard and make trial proposal\n- Bertie as a Designer has been found, and first payment proposal passed for him. (Bertie was introduced by Nico)\n- Start with the Wednesday weekly mesa call, where we talk about the product and strategy. At the start normally Sky/Nico/Adam and me are in the call.\n- We do not reach a deal with Gnosis\n\n- Presentation about Mesa in the community call https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12HuuvWvzAe6HVIDL3RQs_-Td7_JmuxIlrCLjnIJvy5o/edit#slide=id.g7980198e86_0_21\n\n## Overview\n\nHeavy focus on recruiting. Getting a team together. \n\nI had the strategy to hire anyone you wanted to join because I could not wait to get the right people to join.  I recruited on twitter and this worked quite well (Adam/Hamza). (Later Ben/Nathan)\n \nI recruited 2 people, Adam and Hamza for Mesa directly,  Some team members have been pointed to me from outside Lee/Ruy. I had at least 10 calls.\n\nI recruited Adam/Hamza/Ben (I had other candidates, but they dropped out before contributing). I did a lot of babysitting to some.\n\n\n\n\n## Learning\n\n\n- Some form of trust has to be there, new workers have to come in from a angel which makes sens.\n-  People not communication well make no sens in such a setup (Start-up/ Full-Remote and Async)\n- People can learn technical skills if there is a good team interaction quite fast, but character stuff normally doesn't change\n- It makes no sens to have workers which are not interested in the dxDao and what we try to achieve, for this dxDao is just another employer and for them, a normal job is a less risky option.\n- Drop outs can be positive, since Lee left communication is much better\n- Team building takes time, during build-up workers not communicate well can have a high impact (even if he is productive)\n- It's hard to ramp up from zero because people need first to understand what you are trying to build\n- Our recruiting is focused that anons can join, but at the end we have no anons, for all non anons this is strange. We should have a filter for this. Anon: trial 2 weeks as now,  Non-anon: That's your job, start now.\n\n- Not having a working product makes it difficult to onboard because at the start there are no clear tasks to cut out.\n\n## Data/Documents\n\nI made my guide for onboarding: https://hackmd.io/Ak969SQvQU6ulyULfMv_zg\n\nTook part in the Gov2 discussion: https://hackmd.io/FskYlDJkR2GjqMh4wO5fEw\n\n# February 2021: team building, design\n\n## Facts\n\n- Hamza & Ryu joined at the start February\n- Lee joined 8 February\n- Bertie started with the design on February\n- Nico starts working on the smart contracts\n- Lee worked mostly on the single sale pages\n- Hamza worked on the overview page\n- Adam started working on the subgraph\n- Github repo set up with continuous integration\n- Gitub Project as project management\n\n\n## Overview\n\nMostly focus on team building and get the team to understand what we are going to build. Work with Bertie for the Design. Bertie understands the product and was able to creates a nice UX. The Team get to know each other and understands what we are building.\n\n\n## Learning\n\n- In scrum the dev team is responsible to pick a task, define sprint goal and deliver on the sprint end. This only works in an established team where the team feels they are responsible to deliver. Lee, with his little communication, somehow was a blocker to get the team into this mindset. \n \n- Lack of communication from one member can lead to work everyone in silos.\n- For sprints to work, you should make estimates on task, with a new technology and not so well experience devs this is not possible in a serious way\n\n- Bertie could not develop a profound understanding of the auction sales mechanism and not work on charting data on its own. But he had other ideas, which would be suitable for dashboard.\n\n## Data/Documents\n\nShort intro for Scrum Kick-off: https://hackmd.io/avom5FttRfmB3uCER7xP7A\n\n\n# March 2021: Scrum/Research\n\n## Facts:\n\n- Design is finished by Bertie\n- Moved project to trello in the middle of march\n- Start having time boxed daily meetings\n- Venky supports us in your read to agile\n\n## Overview\n\nChange work structure to scrum and start having weekly sprints.  (Venky helped us) \n\nI started to code smart contract to implement some features which, I think, will be important. Research about of chain computation of the settlement price of Fairsale. (Which is possible and maybe would make setting bids cheaper) \n\nI found another, slightly different sale mechanics I call Point-Dutch, which is less capital efficient, simpler and may be more fair in its outcome.\n\nI did focus on research because I was thinking the team was working fine and MVP was quite near. \n\n\n## Learning\n\n- Daily Meeting have been focused and timebox\n- Weekly meeting with show and tell, work with Trello (kanban) and some form of loose weekly goal.\n- At some point the lacking maturity of the team shoes by having merge conflicts. We try to set a standard to work better with git to tackle this.\n- Research has been a success and got me deeper into understanding what we are building, but focus has to be back on a minimal MVP.\n\n\n\n## Data/Documents\n\n- Research if Fairsale would be able to use off chain settlement:  https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-point-dutch-resolver-py\n\n- Smart contract hacking: https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts/commits?author=martinkrung\n\n- Presentation about DXdao in German: https://hackmd.io/s0Pw3FXPQimzI-dDE6WxjA, for https://www.ffhs.ch/en/degree-programmes/continuing-education/cas-blockchain\n\n- Research about Point-Dutch Auction: https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-point-dutch-resolver-py\n\n\n- The way to optimistic roadmap for Q2+: https://hackmd.io/quKURjhZS4OLtRLMiHC9vw\n- Testing gas usage for distributeAllTokens() function in fixed price sale: https://hackmd.io/FRvE-hMjSg-1fSyaWjYEnw\n\n- Analyze Oplis for DXventures: https://hackmd.io/ly1mwXjaTqajkXNeww4jBg\n\n\n# April 2021: Bring the parts together\n\n\n## Facts:\n\n- Lees commitment shrinks considerable, until his fraudulent proposal. I kicked lee out on 16. April.\n- Nico finished core work on smart contract\n- Adam finishes core work on the subgraph\n\n\n## Overview\n\nIt's clear that we could not deliver the MVP as planned. Bring the component together is much harder than we thought.\n\nWork to help to develop the Front-End too, I did add a static page. In a way the team is not as mature as I thought.  We have some pain right now to glue the different components together. They are mostly done, but integrating is more complex than we taught.  I try to make the team to coordinate/communicate better by join the daily work.\n\nI remove lee from the team: After he requests to be paid, in full, I ask him to reduce the request, which he did by himself. (4 weeks -> 3 weeks)\n\nBut even after he committed the proposal he did not pick up work again but showed up in the daily. After this, I did look into what he has worked, and I did clearly see that his performance dropped. \n\nLosing lee this way was a major blow for us.\n\n\n## Data/Documents\n\nMy work on the interface: https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/commits?author=martinkrung\n\nData Types from Smart contract to Front-End: https://hackmd.io/h_RYYe1DR6i1qGhpPcKwNg\n\nLees hours: https://hackmd.io/3RBsVYpaRdyaCezU0SMFoA\n\n\n# May 2021: MVP, MVP\n\n## Facts\n\n- Lee never requested payment for his work in April.\n- Adam tells us that he migrates to Vienna and will stop working for us at the end of the month. (His wish to migrate has been know since the start. He would like to stay, but migration to Europe is only possible eth an official day job).\n- Adam finishes work on the subgraph\n- Nico agreed to work on code clean-up, but take mostly a break in May.\n- Nethan joins the team as Bizdev support\n\n## Overview\n\nWe worked hard to glue all the parts together. The complexity  of the smart contract with factories takes his toll. Team spirit improved, Losing lee had some good side effect that there is much more communication in the team.\n\nWith a shrinking team, I try get a company in to help us. Talk to ethworks and spaceinch.\n\nAt the end of the month we are able to make a purchase on the fix price sale on xdai with a working interface. A new sale can be deployed in  5 min over command line. \n\n\n## Data/Documents\n\nWork which could be done by a external company: https://hackmd.io/AQJdeF7EQhq-eoFQaoEI5g\n\nFeedback on Design from Encasa: https://hackmd.io/hHwezVtBTtCPBRuvepYGXw\n\n\n# Core Learnings over the last months\n\n- The Graph vs other solutions. We just used the standard software for this, but somehow to complex structure of the smart contract made the sub-graph quite complex.\n- I would more try to build everything in parallel and having things connected early, then in single repo.\n- Tech first, less design.\n- Only take selected candidates in the team, communication is key and bad communicators can have big influence.\n- Team building takes time.\n- Do more micromanagement and be more demanding.\n- Less time to try to scrummify processes, just go straight to kanban\n- Overengineering has to be reduced\n- I would not commit any date this early because I committed to finish the MVP at the end of March, even before I had a team.\n\n# Reality of building a product:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zeSRmfH.png)\n\n# Compensation\n\nMy compensation,in accordance with the worker guidelines.

Getting together in Colombia was very positive to align us under the same purpose and generate a nice momentum. I think it will be important to communicate more and better to maintain and increase that unity over time. The urgency of gov2.0 and bringing DAVI to a productive instance is now evident and I am very motivated to help us get there. You can read the last period review [here](https://daotalk.org/t/7-milton-contributor-proposal-19-09-2022-13-11-2022/4555/2).\n\nSince I don’t always have precise visibility of the team’s short-term tasks/priorities for the next 2 months, it has been difficult to set very specific goals or responsibilities in my proposals, rather than general goals aligned with long-term goals or ongoing tasks. I would like to work on it to be able to make more specific validations about my performance and/or take on more responsibilities if my team requires it.\n\nThat said, the scope of my work for this period will remain similar to previous periods: add new features to DAVI and address users feedback, finish work on smart contracts and collaborate with the work started by Madusha of the subgraph and monorepo migration.\n\nIn addition to this, I would like to continue the work we started in the infinite hackathon on off-chain/on-chain mutivote and also to learn a little more about the codebase of other dxdao products.\n\nThere is a gap of days between the end of my last proposal and the beginning of this one (Nov 14-17). Those days I was not working so they are not included here and I won’t claim any payment.\n\n**Goals:**  \n- Finish 1.5 contracts refactor and deploy them after audit feedback is back.\n- Integrate 1.5 contracts to DAVI.\n- Continue the work started on Infinite hackathon regarding on-chain/off-chain multivote for Guilds.\n- Contribute to the monorepo migration and/or subgraph work if needed.\n- Continue working on DAVI development according to the Davi roadmap.\n\n\n**Responsibilities:**   \n- Collaborate with dxGov squad by delivering quality code.\n- Allocate enough time to code reviews for Davi and dxdao-contracts.\n- Being an active member of the squad, participating in meetings/discussions, being available to my teammates in any circumstance they need me.\n- Also allocate some % of my time on governance matters.\n\n**Timeframe:** 2 months.

This is the first period where I have dedicated a significant portion of my time to the contracts. At first, I worked on finishing fixes of 1.5 contract issues and refactoring the voting machine. This was previous to the last audit report.\n\nI also worked on the generation of **documentation for the contracts**. This required several updates in the contracts to follow natspect comments format [https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/natspec-format.html](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/natspec-format.html) You can access the new documentation here: **[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/blob/v2.0/docs/SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/blob/v2.0/docs/SUMMARY.md)**. This was done using solidity-docgen package [https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen)\n\nI worked, as part of the **subgraph work**, with the Argentinian team on implementing guilds feature to retrieve guilds information ( name, guildType, proposals, members) from the subgraph.\n\nI spent part of this period working on the new **monorepo architecture**. We needed to integrate all 4 “projects” together (contracts compilation, local node,  subgraph, and davi) to be able to run our local env for davi.  This required fixes/changes in all projects. After being sure that things worked on the monorepo we deprecated subgraph repository and then davi repository to continue working from the new `davi-monorepo` repository [https://github.com/DXgovernance/davi-monorepo](https://github.com/DXgovernance/davi-monorepo). \n\nAs part of the monorepo setup changes that we needed to do on the contracts (mainly due to subgraph requirements), I spend some time familiarizing myself with current deployment scripts and refactoring the **guilds deployment script**. This was the first period that I got into how we do deployments. I made corrections to the guilds deployment scripts and deployed several guilds on xdai. This was very good to have a clear understanding of the current status and start thinking about what we need to do to build a UI around it. \n\nAlthough I couldn't dedicate as much time as I would have liked to continue the development of the \"**multivote**\" functionality for the guilds, I was able to make some progress. Mainly by cleaning up the code, making some fixes to the signature that wasn't working, and adding tests to it. Here is the work in progress **[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/299](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/299)** which I will keep open for feedback. We need to discuss a bit more technical aspects with the dxGov squad to plan how we are going to implement this.\n\nI also did the **DXD token migration** to dxdao-contracts, which is currently under review, the PR can be found here: **[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/298](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/298)**. As I previously mentioned in the pull request, this is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that the next stages of the Gov v2 contracts are fully prepared, in line with the guidelines outlined in this proposal ⇒ [https://daotalk.org/t/governance-2-0-final-steps/4782](https://daotalk.org/t/governance-2-0-final-steps/4782)\n\nOverall, this was a productive and enlightening period for me. I was able to acquire a lot of new knowledge and skills, and had the opportunity to apply them by making meaningful contributions to the projects. I feel that I have grown a bit technically during this time, and I am grateful for the experiences that I have had.\n\nAs I mentioned, I faced several challenges during this period and I believe that my specific contributions to Davi new features were not as many as in previous periods. I think this was partly due to the nature of this period, but I will try to not stray so far from that feature development for davi in the next period, if it falls within my scope of responsibilities. On the other hand, I am aware that I focused heavily on the technical side and neglected entirely the governance matters of the DAO. \n\n**Payment:**\n\nSince during this period (since January 1st) payment proposals will be submitted to the guild instead of the DAO, I will adjust my payment proposal to receive the percentage (77%) of days that corresponds to 2022. The rest will be submitted to the guild in another proposal.\n\n- $9240 DAI\n- $6160 DXD vested for 3 years with a 1-year cliff starting 18/11/2022.\n- 5866 REP (0.2545% REP based on the mainnet REP supply of 2305060 at the moment of submitting this payment proposal).\n\n","title":" 8.

This proposal places an order for 10.03 WETH using a [$3442.4 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was originally passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45), and extended for another $1m to $3m total, through a further proposal which also passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x56c66f99d87a48d707475aa2466f0a58da13bd744475410957d6572b439cc5bf).

Successful passage of this proposal greenlights eligible Discord participants to their respective mainnet REP allocation, to be claimed through GC.\n\nYou can find the previous signal proposal [here](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x21db513e0abbc00114d4875449ba3694a03a38b63fab6fde9a27037e292a9a37). The forum thread can be found below:\n\n___\n\n## Background\n\nHappy anniversary to the DXdao Discord REP Boosts! Since Q1 of 2021, DXvoice has organized a quarterly REP boost that targets community activity and retention. Now, a year later, there have been four successful Discord REP boosts. As usual, this will need to pass through governance as a signal before users are eligible to claim. Here is some context from the original proposal:\n\n> With the introduction of the DXdao Discord server, @KeenanLuke has proposed an initiative to get more community members involved in Governance. A governance gateway drug, if you will. This functions as a quarterly allocation; a way for us to leave the door open to those most active in the community to further involvement with DXdao and its governance.\n\nIn its current configuration, the DXdao Discord server tracks a user's participation in the preceding quarter and assigns a role based on quantity and quality of the engagement. More information explaining this is coming soon directly within Discord.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nThe below list contains all users eligible for a boost, their respective level, and the allocation of mainnet REP they are entitled to receive. Active DXdao contributors are not eligible for this initiative, and have been removed from the list. Anyone nominated for a [traditional community REP boost](https://daotalk.org/t/community-rep-boosts-apr-2021/2850) is still eligible for this initiative, since high levels are difficult to obtain and the REP is distributed quarterly instead of monthly.\n\nAlthough the entitlement is in mainnet REP, it is highly advised that community members request their REP via DXdao’s Gnosis Chain base - where governance contract interaction is a fraction of a cent. Anyone is welcome to reach out to @KeenanLuke, or any other community member involved with governance, requesting a small amount of xDai to make their REP request proposal and start voting!\n\nIf no concerns have arisen within a few days of this post being live, @KeenanLuke will create a signal proposal on Gnosis Chain to update this initiative. If the proposal passes, @KeenanLuke will notify those who are eligible and assist in the claiming process by updating the “DXdao Discord REP Boost Guide”. The dedicated channel for the Discord REP boosts will be reopened in the Governance category of the DXdao Discord, where eligible participants will be notified.\n\n### Level 1 - 0.00% REP (0 REP)\n\nToo many to list. The requirements for level 1 have been lowered since the Discord REP boosts were proposed, and as such this level will not receive REP in the Q1 2022 boost round.\n\n### Level 2 - 0.01% REP (176.822 REP)\n\n* tibo974#4632(ID: 584965372596453376)\n* Concordians#4499(ID: 760549732337975338)\n* CapiConscious#7099(ID: 788674805452111883)\n* Illpo#8029(ID: 815250424125849610)\n* Richard Williams#0597(ID: 887827035634937886)\n* 0xfbifemboy#9934(ID: 906359266611458059)\n* chandragupta#3272(ID: 907933407185608715)\n* Cutlass#1824(ID: 918035316051423263)\n* Foulke#9505(ID: 918039016044130344)\n* ethereumdan#4514(ID: 943243906181627954)\n* walterbillyhash#9356(ID: 953462069108297788)\n\n### Level 3 - 0.015% REP (265.233 REP)\n\n* snufkin#7489(ID: 293314638467301377)\n* cupOjoseph (🌑, 🦸)#4264(ID: 468883290577960980)\n* Rishabh Khurana#3779(ID: 700530240182550578)\n* Papy pipou| MFL#1943(ID: 707918659854794782)\n* T Wells#9070(ID: 760279960991694848)\n* ugointhecity🦇🔊 |#9239(ID: 813473071897509948)\n* PhiMarHal#9107(ID: 829007024523706386)\n* SydMead400SuperDriver#3726(ID: 847494557859184680)\n* yuanyuan#2101(ID: 870557470706237481)\n\n### Level 4 - 0.02% REP (353.644 REP)\n\n* Tom-Fr#7376(ID: 380406249503850506)\n* Tap#1633(ID: 664974453377335326)\n* DeFi Slate#1221(ID: 885060225533624330)\n\n### Level 5 - 0.03% REP (530.466 REP)\n\n* Spreek#2989(ID: 136272881666621440)\n* lili666#8736(ID: 485027794888294403)\n* Cantillon#9803(ID: 737986068623917117)\n\n### Level 6 - 0.035% REP ( REP)\n\n* Sarah#5260(ID: 272532221259284490)\n* Chiminiv9#2013(ID: 299280741592989696)\n* squidz#3024(ID: 780305537786707969)\n\n### Level 7 - 0.04% REP (618.877 REP)\n\n* TheThriller#2193(ID: 658095818502569985)\n* kirishima#6352(ID: 893219277149175898)\n\n### Level 8 - 0.045% REP (795.700 REP)\n\n* hedgedhog#9790(ID: 107443072576573440)\n* mango#7271(ID: 333060031761088513)\n* SpicySoup#5803(ID: 770240743884849162)\n\n### Level 9 - 0.05% REP (884.111 REP)\n\n* xagxau#5985(ID: 681904611652796515)\n\n### Level 10 - 0.06% REP (1060.933 REP)\n\n* luigy 𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻#1337(ID: 280788802631630858)","title":"Signal Proposal for DXdao Discord REP Boosts Q1 2022","hash":"QmUipRShaM3hmPqHMDWof61RsWUJZ97cgQv2ikj7KyA6Eb"},"0x5e188e55856e8ba3797c894823d93c19d36d5dce3dbd77169ad300880fac2935":{"description":"\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

I also anticipate scheduling to be a bit sporadic with the events in Columbia, including offsite, and will adjust proposal timings as needed and where needed.\n\n0xKLOM.eth has a few forum posts worth checking out from this last period:\n\n- [0xKLOM.eth ETHCC Blockchain week – Happenings, Outlook and Appreciation](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-ethcc-blockchain-week-happenings-outlook-and-appreciation/4425)\n- [Announcing “Operation Decentralization”, A podcast for DeFi, DAO’s and everything in between](https://daotalk.org/t/announcing-operation-decentralization-a-podcast-for-defi-dao-s-and-everything-in-between/4463)\n- [The Tally Ho Pledge](https://daotalk.org/t/the-tally-ho-pledge/4482)\n- [Restructuring and Refocus – An Alternative Proposal](https://daotalk.org/t/restructuring-and-refocus-an-alternative-proposal/4522)\n- [Swapr User Feedback Utilizing useFathom](https://daotalk.org/t/swapr-user-feedback-utilizing-usefathom/4523)\n\n\n## Reflection on previous proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [July to August](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-contributor-proposal-for-07-2022-to-08-2022/4345), what I think I did well includes:\n\n- **Operation Decentralization** - Although there have been hiccups, and the first episode is yet to formally release, the podcast project is coming along very well, with interest from a variety of parties surrounding a thought-provoking launch. We also love the branding!\n- **Content quality** - Once again I am reiterating the increased quality of content for both DXdao and its products. The upcoming landing pages and explainer videos should set a bar we have yet to reach in the past, and it has the whole team extremely excited. More concise scheduling for socials, increased outreach for Infinite drawing in a healthier group of accepted hackers, consistent Discord improvements to UX and security, etc...\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **DXvoice Organization/Leadership** - For an extended period of time I have been discussing/working on better documentation, organization and prioritization flows for DXvoice. Until this point, much of the coordination has happened simply through word of mouth or in notes, which is not scalable. This needs to be expedited. \n\n-  **DXdocs and general documentation activity/participation** - DXdocs continues to fall to the wayside, with other initiatives taking precedence. This is unsustainable, and should have a more formalized release schedule with group participation to keep information both relevant and up to date. The following deliverables from my previous period, although at a very low %, were not completed to my standards.\n\n> - Create and format associated text, run the [DXdocs] project board and ensure relevant deadlines are met.\n> - Coordinate documentation resources from all active DXdao products and squad\n\n## Goals/Responsibilities:\n\n**[65%] DXvoice Coordination and Execution**\n\n* Lead DXdao’s “DXvoice” squad\n  * Organize, run, and manage various initiatives including but not limited to squad calls, marketing processes, community calls, events, content coordination, etc…\n  * Explore potential for DXvoice to further become a more independent entity with its own goals.\n  * Coordinate DXvoice multi-sig execution\n    * Continue to monitor and utilize annual expenditure sheet\n* Keep third party representation of the DXdao brand consistent where possible\n  * Coingecko, CMC, BF, articles, etc…\n* Continue to content push schedule\n  * Encourage third party involvement where feasible\n* Move forward as a public figure for the DXdao Community\n* Continue creation and curation of DXdao Discord servers and the related initiatives\n  * Discord Quarterly REP boosts, Infinite Discord, etc\n* Better integrate squads into content processes to ensure further clarity to both teams\n* Write, Edit, and format content including announcements, MIR, social threads, etc…\n* Continue to work alongside design to build out landing pages and other UX;\n* Continue to manage and automate inflow\n  * User support, Bizdev opportunities, social media inflow, etc…\n* Further guide onboarding of new DXvoice contributors\n\n**[10%] Swapr and Carrot**\n\n* Reflect and explore upon [SWPR tokenomics](https://daotalk.org/t/swpr-token-and-swapr-guild/3118)\n    * Identify and guide a potential SWPR tokenomics upgrade\n* Lead discussions surrounding the future of SWPR emissions, our options and what they mean for the protocol\n* Guide the creation and deployment of monthly Carrot campaign proposals and call data\n* Actively manage and refine SWPR emission strategy\n* Guide the creation and deployment of monthly SWPR emissions proposals and call data\n* Communicate with partner projects and prospective partners surrounding emission schedule\n* Help push any Carrot front-end changes including introduction of new campaigns\n* **I expect these responsibilities to wind down in light of SWPR emissions ending, and will reallocate this time back into DXvoice or Governance depending on the outcome of recent proposals.**\n\n**[5%] Governance**\n\n* Provide an alternative [format for DXdao's restructuring](https://daotalk.org/t/restructuring-and-refocus-an-alternative-proposal/4522) -- guide proposal facets\n  * *If no leadership emerges surrounding the execution of the format, and provided it passes,* assist in communicating and coordinating between REP and DXD holders to identify an equitable path to success for both parties.\n\n**[5%] Contributor Experience**\n\n* Continue to assist with the onboarding process\n* Help address contributor concerns\n* Assist squad with information as needed and relevant resources\n* Help maintain Open Positions document and Bounties, and export to DXdocs\n\n**[5%] DXdocs**\n\n* Continue to lead the [DXdocs effort ](https://dxdocs.eth.link/).

(Reduce fiat to crypto friction, but checking today, even minerva, who has done a sale on gnosis auction/xdai managed not to make a wallet version for this)\n \n* Bodgan of Stater -> learning there: Many projects already have a free tradable token and make their first public sales later. (Also Minerva)\n\n\n## Find an agreement with gnosis about responsibilities in the future (we agree to not agree)  \n\n\n* Gnosis forum entry: https://forum.gnosis.io/t/dxdao-x-gnosisdao-partnership-discussion/905\n* Proposal draft (shared with gnosis): https://hackmd.io/hAtiuLS4RAe40jBqf6dY8Q\n* Variation of possible solutions (My note): https://hackmd.io/2Tv1OzGMRtChwa5VDmbd4w\n\n(No feedback from gnosis, talks later also not lead to any deal)\n\n## Start adaption for Mesa IDO frontend\n\n* Geromimo made a minimal draft and this helped us big to kick off things. Adam implemented a first version of this.\n\n\n## Start of standardization of Service for IDO Projects\n\nThis also helped me to think about who are our costumers:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=671031870\n\nGenerally speaking, my first month set the stage, and we are still executing this.\n\n\n### Other things I worked on\n\n* Analyze different token sale mechanics: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=485683229\n\n\n\n## Long Term/More\n\nFrom my first proposal: https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-martin-krung-24-11-24-12/2363\n\n###  Establish agile project management for Mesa IDO\n\nWe have been doing this, Venky helped me. We have a daily call, which is time-boxed to 15 min, and we have a weekly show and tell call on Monday. We are not doing pure agile, the team is not mature enough.\n\n###  Start a weekly 1h mesa IDO call \n\nI do this every Wednesday. Mostly I do some research what's happening on the market with other IDO project or ongoing sales, we discuss strategy and do some refinement.\n\nSheet with all the calls I made:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=795583827\n\n\n### Take over Mesa deployment from LevelK\n\nNothing to do, old Mesa is defunct now.\n\n### Enhance Documentation for Mesa IDO\n\nWe started a gitbook lately: https://mesa-1.gitbook.io/mesa/\n\nIn general, I did write some things, but after very limited feedback I decide that writing down things does not move the project forward.\n\n### Spread the word about DXdao over my personal twitter account\n\nI do, from time to time, also use it as the main tool for recruiting new members.\n\n### Helping research/develop new products\n\nWe have to finish the 3 products we got, no need for this and if, not my focus right now.\n\n### Help to develop a vision for DXdao\n\nNo time for this, even I think it's still needed.\n\n### Help with decentralized infrastructure research/testing\n\nNo time for this, we use the graph and may be radical but don't run hardware. I guess I mostly wrote this because I have some DevOps skills, running web server for 20y.\n\n### Start to learn smart contract development\n\nI did implement some features (in March) and I have a working environment for this now. I understand even better how smart contract work and what the limits are. I started working as a dev to support the team, to understand pain points and to do some research on a next-generation sale mechanism.\n\nhttps://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts/commits/feature/distributeAllTokens-for-FairSale\nhttps://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts/commits/feature/pointdutch-with-off-chain-sp\n\nOther work in December:\n\nSetup of https://snapshot.page/ for DXdao: https://hackmd.io/Wvj_SUfaRMC8p2D9uo2RHA\n\n\n\n## January 2021 / recruiting\n\n### Facts\n\nAdam started in the second week of February\n\nRecruiting calls with ~10 person\n\nHelp them to onboard and make trial proposal\n\nBertie as a Designer has been found, and first payment proposal passed for him. (Bertie was introduced by Nico)\n\nStart with the Wednesday weekly mesa call, where we talk about the product and strategy. At the start normally Sky/Nico/Adam and me are in the call.\n\nWe do not reach a deal with Gnosis\n\nPresentation about Mesa in the community call Mesa\n\n\n### Overview\nHeavy focus on recruiting. Getting a team together.\n\nI had the strategy to hire anyone you wanted to join because I could not wait to get the right people to join. I recruited on twitter and this worked quite well (Adam/Hamza). (Later Ben/Nathan)\n\nI recruited 2 people, Adam and Hamza for Mesa directly, Some team members have been pointed to me from outside Lee/Ruy. I had at least 10 calls.\n\nI recruited Adam/Hamza/Ben (I had other candidates, but they dropped out before contributing). I did a lot of babysitting to some.\n\n\n# Calculation\n\n## First month 24/11 - 24/12\n\nExperience Level: 5\n\nFull-time, first month,  24/11/2020 - 24/12/2020\n\n$6,400 xDai (80% of $8,000)\n$4,800 DXD (80% of $6,000)\n0.1334% REP (80% of 0.1667%)\n\n\n\nSummary of compensation:\n\n- $6,400 xDai\n- Approval for 4,800 USD to be paid as 9.18 DXD in a vesting contract continuously for two years with a one-year cliff when the work agreement finishes.

(“Double”)\" on Mainnet made by Double.  \n\nMainnet Proposal: https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x95753588421c510d7d9999d5bd5c35aa49e076d532f37cce728e5bd7d4792e93\n\nThe Mainnet proposal takes precedence and moves the funds, but this proposal is to allow for community members to express support or disagreement easily and cheaply on Gnosis Chain.    \n\n**Proposal Text from Mainnet:**\n\n**Summary**\nProposal for DXdao to make a $100,000 grant investment to D2 Labs, Inc. (“Double”).\n\n**Background**\nIn February 2021, DXdao community members proposed the creation of a DXdao venture arm, named DXventures. Community members adopted the idea, and DeFi projects began to contact DXdao regarding opportunities.\n\nDouble is a decentralized co-op platform for AMM liquidity providing that will double LP investors’ return on invested capital while at the same time boost liquidity for projects’ tokens.\n\n**Why Double?**\nAMM trading volume has grown 50x-100x since early 2020 and has at least 30x-50x growth potential in the next 3-4 years. However, the whole AMM ecosystem is still immature and there are big pain points in AMM liquidity providing, where, due to 50:50 AMM pool design, projects lack capital and struggle to boost liquidity for their tokens, while LP investors lack tokens and incur friction, inefficiency and risk to convert capital into tokens so as to chase high APY. Double is a decentralized protocol that enables a win-win partnership between projects and LP investors, which will double LP investors’ return on invested capital while at the same time boost liquidity for projects’ tokens.\n\n**Agreement for Grant Investment from DXdao to Double.**\n(“Grant Investment Agreement”)\n\nThe following states the terms of the Grant Investment Agreement between DXdao and Double.\n\nUpon execution of this onchain proposal DXdao (the “Grantor”) makes a grant investment to D2 Labs, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Grantee”), in the amount of $100,000.00 paid in Dai stablecoins (the “Grant Investment Amount”).\n\nThis Grant Investment Amount is approved as an unrestricted gift to Grantee in furtherance of its support of D2 Labs’ goal to grow the Double protocol.\n\n**The Grant Investment Amount is provided in exchange for:**\nThe Grantor shall have the same right as an investor who invests $100,000 in D2 Lab, Inc. using YC’s Safe agreement with a post-money valuation cap of $10,000,000, for the pro rata share of Equity Holder Tokens (the “Pro Rata Right”). “Pro rata share” for purposes of this Pro Rata Right is (a) prior to the conversion of the Investor’s Safe into Capital Stock, the ratio of (x) the Purchase Amount of $100,000 to (y) the Post-Money Valuation Cap of $10,000,000 and (b) following the conversion of the Investor’s Safe into Capital Stock, the ratio of (x) the number of shares of Capital Stock held by the Investor to (y) the Company Capitalization. The Pro Rata Right described above shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of (i) immediately prior to the closing of a liquidity event; or (ii) immediately prior to a dissolution event. Equity Holder Tokens shall be sent to the DXdao wallet address.\n\nIn the event that the DXdao Address no longer functions as a DXdao-approved contract address used to hold DXdao treasury funds, a separate onchain proposal must be made to a DXdao-Approved Onchain Voting Portal to determine the appropriate Ethereum contract address for which to send Future Tokens.\n\nA DXdao-Approved Voting Portal is defined as any onchain governance portal Grantor actively uses for its onchain decentralized governance voting that manages its onchain treasury. Currently, DXdao-Approved Voting Portals includes DXdao’s DXvote.eth mainnet and xDAI bases located at the following addresses:\n0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a; and 0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f\n\n**Partnership Alignment:**\nAs part of this agreement, Double and DXdao plan to work together to achieve success for both parties. DXdao plans to leverage its ecosystem and experience across governance, community and other skill sets to benefit Double as it grows and matures. Double plans to use its product to advance the use cases of DXdao’s product suite, including future integrations tied to Swapr and Aqua when applicable.\n\n**Conditions:**\nGrantee warrants that the Grant Investment Amount will only be used for the purposes allowed by the IRS and other government agencies relating to grants from decentralized autonomous organizations.\n\nUpon reasonable request by Grantor, Grantee shall provide updates of the progress, and / or status of objectives including how the Grant Amount was expended to attain objectives.\nGrantor may be eligible for warrants exchangeable for Grantee common stock subject to certain conditions and the approval of Grantee’s Board of Directors and conditioned on Grantor’s provision of certain services as a strategic ally to Grantee.\n\nAny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to this Grant Investment Agreement, or the breach thereof, including the issue of arbitrability, shall be exclusively settled by Kleros decentralized arbitration service (“Kleros”), under Kleros arbitration rules. The number of arbitrators shall be based on the Kleros juror selection pool model.","title":"Mirror Proposal of \"Proposal for Grant Investment from DXdao to D2 Labs, Inc.

As a part of this, we decided to refactor a lot of code in the guilds frontend. We split Guilds, which was part of DXvote codebase, out into a new project for better maintainability (Codename: DAVI. I can finally stop referring to it as the new guilds UI!).\n\nWe focused a lot on improving developer experience and code quality, with proper unit and integration testing processes. Storybook was introduced as a valuable developer documentation tool and has already made things easier to develop React components.\n\nWe also received the results of the guilds smart contracts audit from Sigma Prime. The last few weeks of this proposal period was focused on fixing smart contract issues found.\n\nPersonally, my availability and productivity fell off a cliff in May / early-June due to migration plans. It has recovered a bit now, but I expect the migration to take a significant chunk of my time in the next few months as well. (Probably ~15-20%)\n\n### Did well:\n\n- Supporting the refactoring efforts. While my availability wasn’t great, I feel I could positively contribute to the direction we took on refactoring.\n- Smart contract fixes. We were able to get many smart contract issues resolved pretty quickly. I expect the code to be ready to be re-audited in a couple of weeks.\n- Collaborating with the team members on brainstorming. We had many sessions to discuss the refactoring strategy and to discuss future plans on caching etc.\n\n### Improve on\n\n- Communicating my availability with the team. The logistics of my migration meant I had to rush a lot of things at the last minute. This reflected in my communications as well. Going forward hopefully I’d be able to communicate my unavailability in advance so the sprints can be planned with minimum impact.\n- Productivity and availability. I’m already working on improving my productivity. I expect my availability to be reduced for the next few months as well, but will communicate this in advance as mentioned above.\n\n### Work completed\n\n- Find my completed pull requests for [DXvote](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amprasanjith+is%3Aclosed), [DXdao-Contracts](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amprasanjith) and [DAVI](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amprasanjith).\n\n### Compensation:\n\nI am dropping down my compensation to 70% which I believe better reflects the availability I had.\n\n- $4900 ($7000 * 0.7) DAI to be sent on the second payment proposal\n- $3500 DXD ($5000 * 0.7) in a vesting contract continuously for three years, when the work agreement finishes (30/06/22)\n- 0.11669% REP (0.1667% * 0.7), to be sent on the second payment proposal\n","title":" Madusha - Contributor Proposal [01/05/2022 - 30/06/2022] - Second Half","hash":"QmY16i2stfjBauNMHSYbtohbyFzDbKePZYaoWiNZcQPdxz"},"0x6099109a332026baaafec905c9576dec13fb8746086d969b89bea13f95c61d53":{"description":"This proposal launches a AGVE/XDAI farming campaign that starts Thu Nov 11th 2021 at 15:00 and ends Thu Nov 25th 2021 at 15:00; distributing 6,468 SWPR tokens over that time period.\n\nREP holders approved the SWPR token and farming campaigns through a[ signal proposal that passed in August](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x2d00135332c28271ba27c6f02f9aa79a480b4d7c58df37fb30e6a55353470910).

After realizing DXdao is a good fit for me, I decided to join the Keybase. I was approached by Melanie and had a talk with Martin regarding contributing to Mesa.\n\nI have been developing full-stack web applications on React, Node.js, Java Spring and related frameworks and technologies for more than 3 years. Although I’ve been working in the education domain so far, I’ve been very interested in fintech since last year.\n\nI’ve been following crypto and decentralized tech space since 2018, on-and-off with the limited time I had as I was juggling between work and studies. But now I am aligning my career path towards Web3 development. I will be contributing part-time due to my current day-job, but have plans to move full-time once I have the flexibility to do so.\n\n### Timeframe\n1 month or 40 hours. (whichever comes first)\n\n### Proposed Scope of Contribution\n\n**Goals**\n- Work on the current roadmap for the Mesa pre-production MVP release.\n- Work on additional features for Mesa after MVP.\n- Learn more about DXdao and DAOs in general\n- Gain valuable insights and knowledge on Blockchain and Web3 development\n\n\n**Responsibilities**\n- Collaborate with Mesa team members to understand and improve the application\n\nHere are some of the tasks I’ve been working on\n- IPFS Integration for loading sale details on Mesa: [#247](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/pull/247) and [#250](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/pull/250)\n- Various tweaks and bug-fixes on Mesa UI: [#216](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/pull/216), [#225](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/pull/225), [#228](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/pull/228)\n\n### Time commitment\n\nPart-time trial period\n\nI will be completing the trial period over 1 month or 40 hours. (whichever comes first) Afterwards, I will make a proposal for the next 2 months, part-time at 15-20 hours per week.\n\nThe next proposal will have more detailed insights into my responsibilities and time commitment. These are being tracked with Martin and the Mesa team.\n\n### Compensation\n\nExperience Level: 2\n\nSalary - Calculated from full time 40hr week at trial 50% rate:\n- $625 DAI for trial period ($1250 * 50%)\n- 0.72 DXD for trial period (1.43 * 50%) in a vesting contract continuously for two years with a one year cliff when the work agreement finishes (06/07/2021)\n- 293.8 REP for trial period (587.7 * 50%)\n\n### Work Experience\n\n- 3+ years as a full-stack web developer at Pearson\n- [Github](github.com/mprasanjith)\n\n\n### Keybase Verification\n\n```\nBEGIN KEYBASE SALTPACK SIGNED MESSAGE. kXR7VktZdyH7rvq v5weRa0zkTmAXUy h9gGT97ukFfnvvp p8bZ1xjMzNiRIRI IWFMS9dxH1zX7uK 4Qxyka9afeIbM0w 6HZaI2ZYqVcH69r FLalCEnM9LhfiC0 NCkmcdFvdpPUF4c xZTvyWUO9mgTOn9 4rZtgVpUtIbwtiI uRMqKZN756Cok5p hVbKi2kKobUg0do ROUe9RtsQslcYXe .

Below is my self-reflection on how I think I did over the past few months while contributing to the DXdao community.\n\n    What I did well\n        I think I did well at immediately owning the onboarding process by taking over and leading almost all communications with new contributors/candidates.\n        Worker proposal management will be an ongoing and evolving task, however I do think I did well at developing and implementing an alert/ notification system to ensure contributor worker proposals are submitted and up to date\n        All past and current DXD and REP allocations were tracked and delivered, thank you @allq for all of your work on this. I feel satisfied with the outcome of that initiative.\n        All of the immediate Operating Procedures that needed to be revised and completed were done.\n            Alchemy Worker Proposal Submission\n            REP tracking\n            DXD Tracking\n            Worker Proposal Tracking\n    What I did okay\n        Although recruiting wasn’t a primary task on my worker proposal, I still think that I did “okay” in this area. I was able to work with @zett to bring on a front end dev to Swapr and have developed a few processes around improving the recruiting areas of DXdao.\n        Contributor engagement- I was able to meet and speak with every member of the community and am finding my place within DXdao, which was a goal of mine. I give myself an “okay” because it took me longer than 2 weeks to meet with Augusto :wink:\n    What I need to improve on\n        Even though I am pretty content with the influx of contributor worker proposals being submitted, at times errors are still being made during the Alchemy worker proposal submission process. I think I can improve on ensuring a more thorough review is completed of all worker proposal submissions to eliminate errors in this process for the future.\n        In addition, although the alert / notification is very useful, I do not think the structure is scalable as all alerts are being sent manually. I need to spend more time in the upcoming months developing a more scalable and automated solution.\n        I know there are so many areas of web3/DeFi/DAOs that I need to gain knowledge and expertise in. I would say that this is an area that will be a constant area of growth and improvement for me as our DAO and surrounding communities evolve.\n\nCompensation:\n\n    Experience Level 4\n    Time commitment- 100%\n    Contributing to DXdao since 3/22/2021. 2.5 month proposal - 2 week trial and first 2 months\n    Full-time for total of 40 hours per week, for two months (6/1/21- 8/1/21)\n        Month 1\n            $7,000 (xDai)\n            $5,000 (DXD).

I wrote the piece published to the medium as well as the community call. I also wrote a [Twitter thread summary](https://twitter.com/powers_chris/status/1547683887429521408) on my personal account that had 2,500 impressions.\n* Launch [DXLegal Assessments](https://daotalk.org/t/dxlegal-assessments/4304), this is an initiative to contract with a few crypto lawyers on specific needs for DXdao. If successful, they may be a lower-cost engagement (with specialties) than a full-time DAO Counsel. Working with Dave and Melanie on this.\n* Moving! Drove my family and a big ole’ truck down south in the middle of this proposal\n\nWhat I did okay on:\n\n\n\n* [Delegate DXdao’s ENS Tokens to CaneyFork.eth](https://daotalk.org/t/delegate-dxdaos-ens-tokens-to-caneyfork-eth/4387) - I’ve been spending a lot of time in ENS DAO over the past few months, particularly chatting with Neiman. This post lays out a plan for DXdao to become more active in ENS governance. I think it’s in the right direction and “okay” because it took a while.\n* [DXdao Budget 2H2022](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-budget-2h2022/4394) After the DXdao expenses [post](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-expenses-update-june-2022/4285) from Caney Fork’s last worker proposal, squad leads worked on their own individual budgets, which I then consolidated into a [comprehensive line-item 6 month budget](https://dxgov.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma25yTiKpZTv4eZT7oMywtpifsBzKzDJ4yz3V31cXZqXT). This was a great process but not yet complete. Some adjustments incoming along with another reconciliation of expenses. More to come.\n\nWhat I did not do well on:\n\n\n\n* I posted [DXD Buyback and Next Steps July 2022](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-update-and-next-steps-july-2022/4374) to give and update on Buyback program, as well as posted the [DXD Token Working Group](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-token-working-group/4388/10) post last week.

These were all necessary but putting into “not do well” bc we don’t yet have consensus on many of the underlying issues\n* Helping DXdao products. I’m still using them! But I am not as active as I once was with Swapr, DXgov and Carrot. This might actually be _okay_ as my time is better spent on Governance/DXvoice/ContributorX.\n\nJuly Compensation (71%, 4 days a week + newsletter + an extra vacation day on July 28)\n\n\n\n* $6,390 in USDC/Dai \n* $6,745 in DXD, using 30 day average for DXD price or minimum $523, vested for 3 years with one year cliff","title":"Caney Fork Worker Proposal June/July 2022 (2/2)","hash":"QmfQWh423qssNCrJSXwKdmmxmkvKXbmkbqTM8yhHyqe3rg"},"0x63102e644ad552ff1688a6088189ea87760291d68689af847ccf45acc22e5a7c":{"description":"\nThis proposal sends a set of funds to the Quick Wallet Scheme (QWS) on xDai, identified as: `0x983e0c64088E48b6AB7C76a8ABa3eE93d1C10aD5`.\n\nThe QWS allows DXdao to pass proposals quicker, while reducing risks of malicious proposals by limiting what the QWS can do and which funds it has access to.

ETHDenver also went big this year which was great in terms of overall number of people in Denver, but I think left the hackathon and hackers getting less focus and being left a bit behind.\n\nA lot of time is spent keeping up on all communication channels (keybase, discord, various telegram, Daotalk, DXvote, and various calls). To provide leadership and coordination this is necessary. Being behind on communication means possibly missing key and time-sensitive information. However, it is also time consuming. I would estimate greater than 20 hrs per week of my time is spent keeping up with communication. And I think as a result, my involvement in technical architecture and review of smart contract systems is not as in depth and thorough as it should be. I hope to find ways to change this balance. I think maybe relying on other leaders within DXdao to relay relevant types of information to me could allow me to cut back on time spent reading chats or on meetings.

The proposal would continue DXdao’s efforts to use decentralized infrastructure.\n\n**Background**\n\nMany projects in the Web3 space rely on centralized tools or services that run on providers like AWS and Microsoft Azure or relayers that use these providers creating single points of failure.\n\nDXdao believes that eliminating these central points of failure is critical for the future success of decentralized applications running on a fair, censorship resistant internet.\n\nWith this belief in mind, DXdao is heavily exploring opportunities to use better alternatives that are distributed, reliable and redundant.\n\nOne of the projects working to provide a solution is [Pocket Network](https://www.pokt.network/) whose mission is to coordinate open access to the world’s public data by empowering anyone to provide unstoppable infrastructure.\n\nPocket is building a crypto-economic powered relay network for blockchain API requests. The goal is for the network to be more resilient and more reliable than its centralized peers.\n\nEach DXdao product uses an “RPC provider” to send communications to the blockchain through the user’s wallet. At the moment, the two most popular services, Infura and Alchemy, are heavily centralized. Pocket Network can offer this service in a more decentralized way.\n\n**Details**\n\nDXdao has the opportunity to start experimenting with Pocket Network by integrating it into DXdao’s products.\n\nIn parallel, DXdao and its community can participate in the Pocket Network.\n\nDXdao Squads have had numerous communications with members of the Pocket team over the past couple months, including having the Pocket team present and having an open discussion on the public DXbiz Weekly Gathering on Nov 1st.\n\nTo begin exploration, the different DXdao product squads have been looking into the steps around technical integration. With a plan to identify which products to start with, first steps would be to begin sending some portion of DXdao product traffic to Pocket Network.\n\nThe Pocket team/community has created a step-by-step path to becoming a full user and stakeholder in the network.\n\nDXdao can start with experimentation with the backing and help of the Pocket team. There is a mechanism in place for the Pocket team to stake POKT into the network on DXdao’s behalf. As the integration deepend and the relationship between DXdao and Pocket Network matures, there will be an opportunity to become a stakeholder in Pocket Network via acquisition of POKT tokens. The necessary steps for DXdao to “stake” POKT tokens into the network will likely take some technical discovery, but this is something that the Pocket team is also aware of.\n\nPocket Network has a small, but quickly growing community around its network of users. DXdao has the opportunity to lead by example and become an early user and supporter of an critical tooling ecosystem that provides a path towards a future decentralized web that is heavily in line with the core principles and goals of DXdao.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nWith the passage of this signal proposal, DXdao developers will begin exploring integration of Pocket Network into its products, including Swapr, DXvote and Omen.\n\nDXdao will also explore the possibility of acquiring POKT tokens and staking them in a decentralized manner. This represents challenges because Pocket is its own network and DXdao would have to figure out how to control an entity in a trustless manner.\n\nThis signal proposal will also further strengthen the relationship between the Pocket Network and the DXdao community with a potential attendance on a DXdao community call.","title":"Integrate Pocket Network into DXdao product RPC usage [Signal Proposal]","hash":"QmbYraTKTKgAhuvdN8c45m9u8W7QRuZQxfi3TRfyMk5Uvh"},"0x653fa2503a9d3fa394f234ec69e217270e12c0ace69880e4fb9f18509eb9303d":{"description":"I Chiminiv9#2013 am requesting REP in relation to my DXdao Discord participation level.

I have used the new import function from DXvote folks, hopefully this text is comprehensive!`\n\n`This proposal requests Month two’s xDai, and 0.3334% mainnet REP on xDai. This proposal also specifies an owe of 0.3334% of mainnet REP, and $12,000 of DXD based on ATH price. (To be synced/calculated at a later date).`\n\n**Time Frame:** September 13th, 2021 - November 5th, 2021. Full-time with 40 workable days/2 months\n\n**Position:** Lead of DXvoice squad\n\n**Background:** Hey! I’m Keenan. I have been leading the Communications and Marketing Squad (DXvoice) at DXdao. This last period was full of surprises, stress and most importantly - accomplishment. Much of our work in the previous months has culminated in the SWPR token and farming launch on Arbitrum - to what can only be described as a resounding success thus far. I am incredibly proud of the Swapr squad and everyone involved in the launch process, and am excited to continue to move Swapr forward together.\n\nThis proposal also marks an important milestone in my DXdao journey. Within my first non-trial period proposal I had indicated a “long term career goal of attaining experience level 5 within 2 years.”. Since that proposal I have transitioned from a support to a lead, made DXdao and its products my primary focus, and coordinated many initiatives including the operation of the newly established DXvoice squad. I have received incredible support from other DXdao contributors regarding a level increase from 4 to 5, representing me reaching my personal goals far before I had anticipated. My journey has been incredibly fulfilling and exciting thus far. Regardless of whether this level change passes at this time - there is nowhere I would rather be than here.\n\n## Reflection on previous proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [July - Sept](https://daotalk.org/t/keenan-luke-contributor-proposal-for-07-2021-to-09-2021/3140), what I think I did well includes:\n\n* Preparing DXdao and Swapr community facets for potential growth. In preparation for the, at the time, upcoming Swapr Arbitrum release and token launch I had prepared full overhauls of our most common community outlets. This includes Discord navigation, permissions, verification systems, ticketing procedure, moderation delegation, presented information/links, and much more. This was a large success, seeing a massive increase in active accounts and incoming messaging. Big shoutout to @arhat for his deep attention to these channels during the launch period, especially in my absence.\n* Assisting in the facilitation of the SWPR token launch. We launched the SWPR token this period, which was already an incredibly demanding task in itself. On top of this, a deployment hitch caused the necessity of a token migration and contract redeployment. I don’t think I did a good job specifically here, I think that everyone involved in the process from technical to non-technical did an absolutely fantastic job. As for my personal accomplishments in this process, I handled much of the communication strategy surrounding the original launch and subsequent redeployment/migration, marketing materials/post coordination, tokenomics, farming plans and proposal preparation.\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n* Despite the glaring reason of why, I felt I did not do a good enough job managing DXdocs this period. The SWPR launch was incredibly time consuming and left too few gaps to get a comprehensive update out for when I had originally hoped. This will be a priority for me in the coming weeks, including but not limited to intrasquad coordination of technical documentation and roadmapping.\n\n## Goals/Responsibilities:\n\n**[65%] Community, Communications, and Marketing**\n\n* Lead DXdao’s “DXvoice” squad\n  * Organize, run, and manage various initiatives including but not limited to squad calls, marketing processes, community calls, events, content coordination, etc…\n  * Explore the potential for DXvoice to become a more independent entity with its own goals.

Github accounts for a small portion of my completed work.\n\n## Compensation:\n\nAs briefly described in the background section, I will be requesting compensation at level 5 as a result of support from several contributors from differing areas of operation at DXdao. I will give a few extra days of processing on the forum before creating a proposal on-chain - to allow any discussion to be held prior to the voting period.\n\n* Experience Level: 5\n* Full-time.\n* Month one.\n  * $8,000 (xDai) + $81 (xDai).\n  * $6,000 (DXD).

Vested for 2 years.\n  * 0.1667% REP.\n\n$81 accounts for the previously specified $36 monthly community tool costs (statbot, yagpdb, etc..), as well as a new $45 monthly expenditure of Discord boosts to attain level 2 (Better audio quality, banner, community server status, etc). Although these community costs are still small, I would like to transition these to either their own proposal or the multi-sig as the costs grow - bonus benefit of deeper accountability and a trail that can be followed if I were to disappear.\n\nThe first proposal will request Month one’s xDai at the beginning of the period. The second proposal will request Month two’s xDai, and 0.3334% mainnet REP on xDai at the end of the period. The second proposal will also specify owed % of mainnet REP, and owed DXD based on ATH price.\n\n### Compensation Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal falls under the current [Contributor Guidelines](https://bafybeihsrqrrptogajxcwyk3druhqeznfdwsmx5nimstroxeww3z4e7ekq.ipfs.dweb.link/docs/ContributorHub/contributor-compensation/), enacted on [February 17, 2021.](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xb8573e88aa824eda562e3673f1bfe058fe7b379db85dd11ec48758c15cb67b49)\n\nShould DXdao approve any changes to the Contributor Guidelines Compensation Structure that go into effect during my stated contract period, I reserve the right to introduce a new Daotalk post and on-chain proposal to adjust the above stated compensation amounts to reflect the new compensation structure.\n\nI am aware that any change in my compensation level must be reviewed and approved by my squad, squad leader, and the Contributor UX leader, before I can make a new proposal for this change in compensation.","title":"Keenan Luke Contributor Proposal for 09/2021 to 11/2021 2/2","hash":"QmU4enoz9ZvUTdkWMMYKYrwpFGn3aVm5kc5WDEQEs5fJ4t"},"0x660b0ae37d94222d2c508a7ba0bd8b5731819ec11654b83c93f94e9730752a9b":{"description":"This proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

(The unstoppable marching of time...) Much of DXvoice's priorities for early this month will surround preparations for Infinite hackathons and other events in Bogota. We will also be focusing on pushing deadlines where possible to before October, to try to have a concise content offering ahead of the big events. I also anticipate scheduling to be a bit sporadic with the events in Columbia, including offsite, and will adjust proposal timings as needed and where needed.\n\n0xKLOM.eth has a few forum posts worth checking out from this last period:\n\n- [0xKLOM.eth ETHCC Blockchain week – Happenings, Outlook and Appreciation](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-ethcc-blockchain-week-happenings-outlook-and-appreciation/4425)\n- [Announcing “Operation Decentralization”, A podcast for DeFi, DAO’s and everything in between](https://daotalk.org/t/announcing-operation-decentralization-a-podcast-for-defi-dao-s-and-everything-in-between/4463)\n- [The Tally Ho Pledge](https://daotalk.org/t/the-tally-ho-pledge/4482)\n- [Restructuring and Refocus – An Alternative Proposal](https://daotalk.org/t/restructuring-and-refocus-an-alternative-proposal/4522)\n- [Swapr User Feedback Utilizing useFathom](https://daotalk.org/t/swapr-user-feedback-utilizing-usefathom/4523)\n\n\n## Reflection on previous proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [July to August](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-contributor-proposal-for-07-2022-to-08-2022/4345), what I think I did well includes:\n\n- **Operation Decentralization** - Although there have been hiccups, and the first episode is yet to formally release, the podcast project is coming along very well, with interest from a variety of parties surrounding a thought-provoking launch. We also love the branding!\n- **Content quality** - Once again I am reiterating the increased quality of content for both DXdao and its products. The upcoming landing pages and explainer videos should set a bar we have yet to reach in the past, and it has the whole team extremely excited. More concise scheduling for socials, increased outreach for Infinite drawing in a healthier group of accepted hackers, consistent Discord improvements to UX and security, etc...\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **DXvoice Organization/Leadership** - For an extended period of time I have been discussing/working on better documentation, organization and prioritization flows for DXvoice. Until this point, much of the coordination has happened simply through word of mouth or in notes, which is not scalable. This needs to be expedited. \n\n-  **DXdocs and general documentation activity/participation** - DXdocs continues to fall to the wayside, with other initiatives taking precedence. This is unsustainable, and should have a more formalized release schedule with group participation to keep information both relevant and up to date. The following deliverables from my previous period, although at a very low %, were not completed to my standards.\n\n> - Create and format associated text, run the [DXdocs] project board and ensure relevant deadlines are met.\n> - Coordinate documentation resources from all active DXdao products and squad\n\n## Goals/Responsibilities:\n\n**[65%] DXvoice Coordination and Execution**\n\n* Lead DXdao’s “DXvoice” squad\n  * Organize, run, and manage various initiatives including but not limited to squad calls, marketing processes, community calls, events, content coordination, etc…\n  * Explore potential for DXvoice to further become a more independent entity with its own goals.\n  * Coordinate DXvoice multi-sig execution\n    * Continue to monitor and utilize annual expenditure sheet\n* Keep third party representation of the DXdao brand consistent where possible\n  * Coingecko, CMC, BF, articles, etc…\n* Continue to content push schedule\n  * Encourage third party involvement where feasible\n* Move forward as a public figure for the DXdao Community\n* Continue creation and curation of DXdao Discord servers and the related initiatives\n  * Discord Quarterly REP boosts, Infinite Discord, etc\n* Better integrate squads into content processes to ensure further clarity to both teams\n* Write, Edit, and format content including announcements, MIR, social threads, etc…\n* Continue to work alongside design to build out landing pages and other UX;\n* Continue to manage and automate inflow\n  * User support, Bizdev opportunities, social media inflow, etc…\n* Further guide onboarding of new DXvoice contributors\n\n**[10%] Swapr and Carrot**\n\n* Reflect and explore upon [SWPR tokenomics](https://daotalk.org/t/swpr-token-and-swapr-guild/3118)\n    * Identify and guide a potential SWPR tokenomics upgrade\n* Lead discussions surrounding the future of SWPR emissions, our options and what they mean for the protocol\n* Guide the creation and deployment of monthly Carrot campaign proposals and call data\n* Actively manage and refine SWPR emission strategy\n* Guide the creation and deployment of monthly SWPR emissions proposals and call data\n* Communicate with partner projects and prospective partners surrounding emission schedule\n* Help push any Carrot front-end changes including introduction of new campaigns\n* **I expect these responsibilities to wind down in light of SWPR emissions ending, and will reallocate this time back into DXvoice or Governance depending on the outcome of recent proposals.**\n\n**[5%] Governance**\n\n* Provide an alternative [format for DXdao's restructuring](https://daotalk.org/t/restructuring-and-refocus-an-alternative-proposal/4522) -- guide proposal facets\n  * *If no leadership emerges surrounding the execution of the format, and provided it passes,* assist in communicating and coordinating between REP and DXD holders to identify an equitable path to success for both parties.\n\n**[5%] Contributor Experience**\n\n* Continue to assist with the onboarding process\n* Help address contributor concerns\n* Assist squad with information as needed and relevant resources\n* Help maintain Open Positions document and Bounties, and export to DXdocs\n\n**[5%] DXdocs**\n\n* Continue to lead the [DXdocs effort ](https://dxdocs.eth.link/).

Help manage proposal process, track and communicate progress and adjust program in conjunction with community feedback and market conditions\n* Work with squad leads on developing a 6 month budget\n* Explore DXdao’s participation in ENS governance. Work with Niemann on how to get more .ETH websites and get ENS app on .ETH\n* Goals/tasks for this period: DXdao & ENS governance by July 7.

The goal was to have dynamically-settable contract addresses on xDai, so that the community could then deploy the contracts themselves and build the correct dapp version that would then be xDai-compatible. Proof [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/190).\n\n- Integrated Baoswap on xDai among the \"ecoroutable\" platforms. Proof [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/200).\n\n- Added/improved support for token icons on both xDai and mainnet. On the same note, the performance of the token picker has also been improved by using a virtualized list (supports more token at a time without performance hits). Proof [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/201).\n\n- Finalized the network switcher feature, through which users can easily switch between Swapr on xDai and mainnet directly from the dapp (when a wallet is not connected). Proof [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/203).\n\n- Done major improvements to the farming UI. Polishment includes pagination on both aggregated and single pair's data, sorting by cumulative reward left in USD in each campaign, showing USD reward left in campaign modal, support multiple rewards (not in the creation form), code cleaning by moving part of the liquidity mining campaign logic to the SDK (like APY calculation etc), improved skeleton loaders usage, full review of staking and withdraw modals (in particular, they now both use a currency input panel similar to the one used in the swap box and correctly show the maximum stakable/withdrawable amount, also supporting multiple rewards claiming), divided campaigns into tabs (currently active, upcoming, expired and \"my positions\" when a wallet is connected), made the whole thing responsive, dynamic token logo when proper logo is not found. Also implemented staking cap in the creation form, correctly handling it from the staking/claiming perspective in the UI, and update pairs picker so that only compatible pairs can be picked when creating a campaign (also the list got virtualized, improving performances). Proof [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/commits/feature/farming).\n\n- On the farming contracts, added view function to easily get total claimable rewards for a certain staker, implemented exit functionality (claim & withdraw all) and implemented staking cap. The contracts have been sent out for a second review after reported stuff in the previous audit was fixed. Proof of work is [here](https://github.com/luzzif/erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts/commits/master).\n\n- Worked on DXstats to finish the multi-chain feature. We're now at a point where DXstats correctly reads and displays multi-chain data and is currently under test awaiting for a release.

This was discussed on [DAOTalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-feb-mar-2022/3997/2).\n\n\nWhat I did well:\n - ETH Denver was a lot of fun and thought I was present at the booth, [giving presentations](https://twitter.com/KeenanLukeCCC/status/1494009948510081029), [speaking on panels](https://twitter.com/DXdao_/status/1493696932383899648), as well as conversing with a host of people from the DXdao community and wider crypto ecosystem. \n - Cow liquidity mining campaigns on Swapr. This showcased Swapr’s capabilities and was a team-wide effort. I liaised with the CoW team and came up with the [campaign parameters](https://daotalk.org/t/approve-swapr-farming-campaign-for-cow-weth-pair/4013), submitted [the signal proposal to approve the campaigns](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/xdai/proposal/0x3f131d40fb2c9e0d8d771ceeaa0fea5919261536152093fc0d02e8bd79e50438), as well as serving as multi-sig signer on launch day\n - Community Call hosting - I thought I did a pretty good job in Keenan’s absence, but maybe others would prefer just the lofi beats...\n\n\nWhat I did okay:\n - [Codeless Conduct hackathon](https://twitter.com/DXdao_/status/1496540201287573505). This is a new initiative so the “fruits” of the hackathon were limited, but I was the lead for the hackathon and thought I did a good job representing DXdao at the opening/closing ceremony. It was helpful to expand the DXdao brand to new people as well as build relationships with other projects in the 1kx ecosystem. \n - [DXD Buyback Program Adjustments and Clarification](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-program-adjustments-and-clarification/4108) - a post that I said I would make it my last proposal that I belatedly posted this week, and why this proposal is late. I think the post is in the right direction for DXdao governance, but it could have come much sooner\n - DXvote and DXgov testing - still a power user, but did not do as good of a job submitting tickets or giving feedback. Hopefully, there will be more activity once guilds are finished\n\n\nWhat I did not do well on:\n - Proposal tardiness. This is a few weeks after it should have been, but ahead of where I was in my worker proposal\n - Budget/expenses - I completed the expenses through February 2022, but have not had the time/resources to put it into a forward-looking budget.

(“Opolis”), with 475,197 $WORK coming as rewards for the contribution; 20% vested/unlocked and 80% vesting over 4 years. Future $WORK tokens that would represent 0.33% equity in Opolis, upon any sale, merger, or liquidation of Opolis at the time of the transaction. \n\n**Background** \n\nIn February 2021, DXdao community members proposed the creation of a DXdao venture arm, named DXventures. Community members adopted the idea, and DeFi projects began to contact DXdao regarding investment opportunities. Opolis approached DXdao to participate in Opolis’s Genesis Coalition as a grant investor. \n\nOpolis is a digital employment cooperative that offers independent workers fully portable benefits, payroll, and shared services. Opolis was created in order to provide contractors in the cryptocurrency space means by which to navigate the concerns that arise when handling health insurance, payroll, and tax issues while being paid in cryptocurrencies. Opolis was founded in Denver, Colorado, and currently focuses its cooperative membership services within the United States, and it also has plans to expand outside of the United States in the next one to two years.  \n\nOpolis, a Delaware corporation, is the funding and launching arm of the Employment Commons, LCA (“Commons”), a Colorado cooperative. Members can join the Commons to receive a variety of contractor-related benefits and use $WORK tokens to stake, use in governance, and hold ownership of the Commons.  \n\nOn April 26, 2021, a DXdao contributor posted a DXVentures proposal for the DXdao community to signal the approval of a $100,000 grant investment to Opolis in exchange for $WORK tokens and a warrant for future $WORK tokens in the value of 0.33% of equity in Opolis in the event of a sale, merger, or dissolution of Opolis. After some discussion and a DXD Snapshot,  the DXdao community gave signal to go forward with an onchain proposal for a $100,000 grant investment to Opolis\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nAgreement for Grant Investment from DXdao to Opolis, Inc. \n(“Grant Investment Agreement”)\n\nThe following states the terms of the Grant Investment Agreement between DXdao and Opolis.  \t \t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nUpon execution of this onchain proposal DXdao (the “Grantor”) makes a grant investment to Opolis, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Grantee”), in the amount of $100,000.00 paid in xDai stablecoins (the “Grant Investment Amount”). \nThis Grant Investment Amount is approved as an unrestricted gift to Grantee in furtherance of its support of the Employment Commons, LCA (the “Commons”), which aligns economic incentives among members of the Commons in support of the future of the independent, self-sovereign worker (the “Grant Investment Agreement”). \n\nThe Grant Investment Amount is provided in exchange for: \n475,197 $WORK Rewards (“$WORK Token Allocation”), to be vested into Grantor’s xDai treasury contract address 0xe716EC63C5673B3a4732D22909b38d779fa47c3F (the “xDai Address”). 20% of the $WORK Token Allocation, in the amount of 95,040 $WORK, to vest immediately upon execution of this Grant Investment Agreement, with the remaining $WORK Token Allocation to completely vest over the course, and at the conclusion, of four (4) years from the date of the execution of this Grant Investment Agreement.  \n\nIn the event of sale, liquidation, and / or merger of Grantee, Grantor shall receive a number of $WORK tokens equalling 0.33% in equity of Grantee’s assets (“Future $WORK”). The value of 0.33% equity in Grantee shall be calculated at the time of sale, liquidation, or merger of Grantee. Upon sale, liquidation, or merger of Grantee, Future $WORK shall be sent to the xDai Address. \n\t\nIn the event that the xDai Address no longer functions as a DXdao-approved  contract address used to hold DXdao treasury funds, a separate onchain proposal must be made to a DXdao-Approved Onchain Voting Portal to determine the appropriate Ethereum contract address for which to send Future $WORK. \n\nA DXdao-Approved Voting Portal is defined as any onchain governance portal Grantor actively uses for its onchain decentralized governance voting that manages its onchain treasury. Currently, DXdao-Approved Voting Portals include DXdao Alchemy mainnet and xDAi bases located at the following addresses: https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a; and https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f. \n\n**Conditions**:\t\n\t\t\nGrantee warrants that the Grant Investment Amount will only be used for the purposes allowed by the IRS and other government agencies relating to grants from decentralized autonomous organizations.\t\t\t\t\t\nUpon reasonable request by Grantor, Grantee shall provide updates of the progress, and / or status of objectives including how the Grant Amount was expended to attain objectives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGrantor may be eligible for warrants exchangeable for Grantee common stock subject to certain conditions and the approval of Grantee’s Board of Directors and conditioned on Grantor’s provision of certain services as a strategic ally to Grantee.\n\t\t\t\nAny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to this Grant Investment Agreement, or the breach thereof, including the issue of arbitrability, shall be exclusively settled by Kleros decentralized arbitration service (“Kleros”), under Kleros arbitration rules. The number of arbitrators shall be based on the Kleros juror selection pool model.

DXdao participated in GGG as a sponsor and conducted multiple talks and workshops throughout the week-long conference. It was a positive experience for so many DXdao contributors to attend the conference. During GGG I co-led a Contributor Experience focused workshop at the DAOist on “Building Healthier Teams.” This workshop allowed me the opportunity to discuss the challenges contributors face within a DAO, as well as highlight the amazing work DXdao is doing in the people operations area of our DAO. A detailed article on the workshop can be found here: The Daoist GGG - “Open Office Hours” — The DAOist\n\nWhat was okay:\n\nIn the past 2 months, I supported the onboarding of 2 new developers, @jorgelopes @velusgautam and QA engineer @Philipp16. I believe I did okay at integrating these new contributors with the current contributors at DXdao. As we grow, my goal is to ensure new contributors are not only onboarding by familiarizing themselves with DXdao operations, but through consistent collaboration with contributors in the DXdao community as well. Virtual retreats and happy hours have been proposed as potential opportunities to facilitate new and existing contributor unification.\n\nWhat needs improvement:\n\nDuring this proposal period we began the search for our next DAO Counsel. @powers, @fluiddrop, and I conducted multiple calls with contributor applicants. However, due to the complexity of the role we were unable to successfully source a new contributor to take over this position. Since then we have found multiple candidates who can potentially fill this role, and plan to onboard them during this upcoming period.\n\nCompensation:\n\nThis proposal falls under the new compensation structure enacted from 01/01/2022\n\n- Level 6\n- Time commitment- 100%\n- Contributing to DXdao since 3/22/2021\n- Full-time for total of 40 hours per week, for two months (6/1/2022-7/30/2022)\n\nMonth 1\n\n- $8,000 (xDAI)\n- $6,000 (DXD).

This was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-aug-sept-2021-draft/3167).\n\nBelow is a reflection on my work during the proposal period\n\n\nBelow is a recap and review of Caney Work’s August and September scope of work. See this post for [Caney Fork’s Oct/Nov proposal draft](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-oct-nov-2021/3418).\n\nWhat I did well:\n\n* Had a baby! Well, my partner did. This has been a whirlwind and an absolute thrill. I took 2.5 weeks off over this work period.\n* Buyback - we easily reached the $1m purchase goal by 9/30 and the buyback was then extended again. And while there are many things to improve (speed, new methods, etc), facilitating the buyback is a core function of my role.\n* Helped onboard Nissa and facilitated engagement with Position Co along with Melanie and Contributro UX squad. This was an interesting experiment over the last few months of finding specific talent for DXdao.\n* Helped facilitate relationship with SpaceInch. The development team seems to be happy with their work and I think it can be a model for how DXdao engages with contractors in the future.\n\nWhat I did okay on:\n\n* SWPR launch on Arbitrum - Swapr squad, DXvoice and others did a fantastic job of conducting and communicating launch and addressing the few snafus that arose. This is a big accomplishment for DXdao and “did okay” for me bc I played a small part.\n* DXvoice and content creation - happy contributor to DXvoice and can now do the MIR with Keenan in my sleep. I felt my output during this proposal was below previous months.\n* Gov_dev & Gov 2.0 development - I’m very happy with the emergence of the gov_dev team and cannot take credit for anything there but Dave and I are forming a great working relationship with Augusto/Ross and gov_dev team, building for our own governance needs.\n\nWhat I did not do okay on\n\n* Time management - with the baby, I need to get into a new rhythm in my work week. It was challenging to switch from working whenever to having huge chunks of a day (or the weekend) where I’m disconnected. I was late with some things, this worker proposal and recap and the Buyback extension proposal could have passed 5-6 days before when the ceiling was reached. I need to work on planning out my weeks, and I also need to narrow the scope of things I engage with.\n* A resolution to DXD vesting. This is a major “to-do” that I have not been able to complete. We discussed it in the community and reached soft consensus but I haven’t put it all together for something we can move forward on.\n* I feel that we need more of a structure for getting larger governance proposals through (DXventures, Treasury, others). Perhaps we need a more formal ‘signalling’ process to help things get along, but I feel there is a governance process void that I should be filling.\n* Compensation change - the proposed plan did not pass and there should have been a better governance process for coming to that decision.\n* We need to get better at incorporating DXD holders into formal governance. It’s hard to run dual-tracks (especially with 3 bases) but we should figure out ways to engage before Gov 2.0\n\nCompensation:\n\n* $7200 as Level 5 Worker \n* $5400 DXD, priced at Coingecko ATH on Sep 1 ($567) or 9.52 DXD a month vested for 2 years with a one year cliff, to be issued once a payroll system is in place\n* 2490 Mainnet REP","title":"Caney Fork Payout September 2021","hash":"QmYXS6hKR7sssPZriHuPVrFSav9CmoXLcJknng696JDXUx"},"0x6d7697643c499ead500ccd5e8cba9049b549e282f2dc2e3cae8a7ba9e1a4c1b2":{"description":"The erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts, which are used for Swapr DIY Farming, have been updated to allow the ability add rewards to ongoing campaigns. This feature is desired to allow multiple parties to contribute to funding a campaign and also to be able to increase the rewards rate of a campaign. One of the original motivations for developing the feature was in thinking about how an Omen Guild would want to experiment with many campaigns and add rewards to successful ones.\n\nThis proposal is to fund an audit of the updated erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts by Team Omega.\n\n**Scope of the Audit**\n\nThe code to be audited will be about 500-600 lines of Solidity code, comprising a contract suite to bootstrap staking campaigns. The code to be audited is on github, here: \n\nhttps://github.com/luzzif/erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts/tree/master/contracts\n\nat commit `ee0605eee011394af82b90f407a9393e17e358fc`\n\nand includes\n`ERC20StakingRewardsDistribution.sol`\n`ERC20StakingRewardsDistributionFactory.sol`\n but excludes\n`StandaloneERC20StakingRewardsDistribution.sol`\n\nThe auditing process includes:\n\n* A thorough inspection of all the code, and the Solidity contracts in particular\n* An analysis of whether the contracts implement the behavior described in the specifications\n\n* Automatic analysis of the contracts using tools such as Slyther and MythX\n* An assessment of the tests and test coverage\n\n* An assessment of how these contracts will be used in a wider context\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nTeam Omega findings will be formalized in a **first report** that includes\n\n* A description of the methods used for the audit\n* An evaluation of the overall quality of the code, including test coverage and documentation\n* A description of any issues we find\n\nAfter the first report is delivered and the developers have addressed any issues that were found, Team Omega will review these fixes and deliver a **final report** in which it is verified that any errors or vulnerabilities previously identified have been properly remediated.\n\nAny additional reviews are subject to newly negotiated terms and pricing.\n\n**Team Omega**\n\nThe audit report will be compiled on the basis of the findings from three auditors.  The auditors work independently.   Each of the auditors has years of experience in developing smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\n**Liability**\n\nThe audit will be on a best-effort basis. In particular, the audit does not represent any guarantee that the software is free of bugs or other issues, nor is it an endorsement by Team Omega of any of the functionality implemented by the software.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe review process will start from the day when the first payment has been received and the code to be audited is provided\n\n* DXdao will deliver the code to be audited no later than November 15\n* The first report will be delivered within 2 weeks of the starting date. \n* DXdao will address any issues within 2 weeks of delivery of the first report\n* The final report will be delivered within 1 weeks after the developers have addressed any issues we may have found\n\n**Cost**\n\nTotal cost is $12,000, half upfront included in this proposal, and the other half due upon completion. In addition to the first payment of $6000, this proposal also included $200 to cover gas costs for transferring funds to mainnet. The main motivation for the proposal being on xDai is to avoid the high cost to DXdao in passing proposals on mainnet.","title":"Audit of Staking Contracts v2","hash":"QmW8TMs21VdUTTzqzNFqitW1vYe52ERErLMKMAQuJge9zx"},"0x6d9c3ee04555446647a3a78eced5bde7a7ba7db9a6fa3921d0cf46f417badc78":{"description":"Hey, This was my post about working with dxDao parttime and during the 2 weeks that I worked parttime, this is what I have been working on: \n\nWorked with Mesa in setting up their SCRUM processes.

Find[ December/January’s DAOtalk proposal here](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-dec-21-jan-22/3702).\n\nWhat I did well:\n\n\n\n* [Talk at DAOist](https://twitter.com/DXdao_/status/1453158982747672584) and other DXvoice/community building endeavors. The DAOist was a great showcase for DXdao and was happy to be able to present on multichain governance there. I also think I’ve done a better job of being more active on Discord and even some Twitter. I enjoyed being on[ Chris Blec’s podcast with John and Augusto](https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1461765983782285320) and promise to not record from a cave next time. And[ October](https://medium.com/dxdao/dxdao-month-in-review-october-2021-b32c911faa00) and[ November](https://medium.com/dxdao/dxdao-month-in-review-september-2021-10c1c189a904)’s month in review.\n* Working with DXgov and product testing DXvote. Dave and I are the ‘power users’ of DXvote and have been[ providing feedback and testing](https://github.com/powerschris). The[ discovery of the Wallet Scheme](https://daotalk.org/t/walletscheme-bug/3657/3) bug is an example of this. Even though I missed a goal of a Gov 2.0 post, Ross is doing a great job of providing updates.\n* [DXdao Proposal Taxonomy](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-proposal-taxonomy/3665) - hopefully, this is a valuable resource for DXdao governance. Going forward, I hope to do more high-level analysis and framing, instead of just concentrating on the daily grind of governance.\n* [Multi-sig signer, on-chain executor and gas price estimator extraordinaire](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91628ddc3a6ff9b48a2f34fc315d243eb07a9501)\n\nWhat I did okay:\n\n\n\n* Support Dave with treasury efforts. Buyback was just extended for another $1m and almost[ 8k DXD has been acquired](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing). Dave is driving proposal submission, tracking and also the last on-chain extension. We’ve adjusted some things to make it more streamlined and hope to automate more in the future. I’m still compiling the DXD volume, but I kinda enjoy that bc it makes me look at recent DXD volume.\n* Swapr farming proposals - This takes a good amount of coordination every two weeks and I’ve been helping Venky and Keenan implement them. We were delayed once but majority votes saved us. There still needs to be some additional coordination on making them more efficient.\n\nWhat I did not do okay on:\n\n\n\n* I feel my output has declined in the past few months. Most of this is because I am adjusting to parenthood and the different work schedules, but I think I could do a better job of prioritizing and planning. I also think I’m experiencing a bit of burnout after 2020/2021 in DeFi/DXdao. I’m hoping some time off and the start of childcare will give me a better foundation for 2022.\n* Budget tracking & DXD vesting compensation - think the DXD vesting signal proposal could have happened sooner and probably should have been submitted before being prompted by contributors. Budget tracking needs attention but it’s a laborious task and need to figure out how to streamline. DXvote integrations could help a lot. Will work with Dave, Ally and DXgov on this.\n* Marketing Lead Candidate Search - this did not work out as planned. Hopefully, lessons were learned by all involved. Building and working in crypto is tough work and then layering a revolutionary new work environment on top makes things trickier. I could have done a better job of engaging with Nissa and seeking feedback from contributors on how things were working out.\n\nPayout logistics\n\n\n\n* This proposal is a payout for November 2021 at Level 5 in the[ Worker Compensation Guidelines](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTLSa4uyKJ71G1GViysJLVoawqPcHZ8L6B9eZjuMeM8ok).

A separate post with more detail on this is coming shortly, and I will provide a link here when posted.\nBuyback transparency documentation with @powers and @fluiddrop\nDXVentures assistance. This is a fun new area for DXdao – a true DAO with an on-chain treasury – to explore how we will format contractual agreements for investments, the goal being to make any agreement as automated as possible. I’m looking forward to how we get to experiment here. Thanks @sky for driving this initiative.\nDXVote assistance in sussing out parameters. @augustol is going to continue work on DXvote now that he has completed some great work on OMN Guild token. I invite others to review and make suggestions for DXVote’s UI and parameters on Github. We’d like to make this project as much as a hive effort as possible.\n“Contributor UX” assistance.

The logic was that my partner and I believed our experience placed us at a level 5, but we first wanted to prove value at Level 4. This work period, I intend to move up to level 5 given my expanding responsibilities and past experience.\n\nFull-time for total of 40 hours per week, for two months (3.12.21 - 5.12.21):\n\n$16,000 (DAI) 50% to be paid once the proposal gets approved and 50% on or after 5/12/2021 when the work agreement finishes.\n\n$12,000 (DXD). $6,000 (DXD) vested at 1 year, and $5,000 (DXD) vested after the first year on a linear schedule.\n\n0.3334% REP\n\nI joined DXdao as a part-time contributor as of 12/12/20. Prior to this, I, along with my partner under @pulpmachina, contributed for two (2) months through DAOtalk topic posts, meeting participation, and Keybase / Telegram discussions.

This kindled my curiosity in internet-native organizations and decentralization and I now plan to dedicate myself full time to learning more about development for Web3 and DAOs.\n\n**Timeframe:**\n1 month\nStarting at 18th of April\n\n**Proposed Scope of Contribution:**\n**Goals:**\n* Start Eco Routing V2 Implement\n* Include More Eco Routing markets.

There were many personal highlights and milestones for me during this period. I officially finished working at my “9-5er” and joined DXdao as a full time contributor, cementing my fall DAOn the rabbit hole! This granted me the opportunity to devote all my “thinking” time to DXdao and how I can contribute and add value (while proofreading, I wanted to change devote into DXvote :laughing: - shows how much I have been DXdao’d!)\n\nOn top of all the professional growth, I was given the opportunity to attend ETHAmsterdam which was another milestone in my web3 journey. Definitely on par with finding DXdao for the first time. Meeting the contributors, whom I had only spoken to on calls and heard in meetings, irl was just plain fantastic and will remain with me always!\n\nFrom a personal point of view: the meeting, talking, having dinners and getting to know one another was totally humanizing and heartwarming, and I enjoyed every minute. From a professional point of view, seeing the contributors in action both on and off the stage was awesome! I learnt so much from them about how to interact with other attendees and how to present DXdao. It is difficult to quantify all the subtle lessons here, but in a nutshell, for me the ETHAmsterdam experience was invaluable and unforgettable from both the personal and professional aspect.\n\nWhen I look back and reflect on the past two months I can only be grateful. I am super excited for what the next two months will hold as I further delve into all things DXdao and web3. It is difficult for me to comprehend that it has only been 4.5 months since starting with DXdao.\n\nThank you all once again and as always I welcome any feedback, notes or criticism.\n\nRole:\n\nSocial Media and Community Growth Contributor\n\nTime frame:\n\n2 Month Period - 31.05.2022 - 25.07.2022 (40 hours/week)\nReflection on goals and responsibilities:\nWhat I think I did well in relation to my goals:\n\n1. Improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products and services.\n\nI am happy with the increase of my knowledge in this regard. While I still have lots to learn I no longer feel like I am fumbling around in the dark.\n\n2. Continue clarifying existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities and take them on as my “own”.\n\nIn the past two months I made a point of identifying as many aspects of DXdao’s operations that fall within the community notification framework to ensure that I take “ownership” of these. To make sure the correct information goes out in a timely manner. While there is still work to be done in this area, progress has been good and systems are being created and falling into place.\n\n3. Get to know the remaining key contributors that I have not yet met.\n\nI have gotten to know more contributors and ETHAmsterdam helped a lot with this. I will continue to slowly introduce myself to the community and make contact.\nWhat I think I did well in relation to my Responsibilities:\n\n1. Continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere:\n\nTweets have been coming out in a consistent and timely manner. Quality has been good with an added focus on highlighting the efforts of contributors who represent/ed DXdao in a public manner.\n\n2. Social Engagement:\n\nBetween my activity on Twitter, Medium and at ETHAmsterdam I think that I have been part of the collective that has helped increase the awareness of DXdao and its products. I would also add that while I did this for the public, I picked up a whole lot of knowledge and awareness for myself at the same time.\n\n3. Communications:\n\nI think there has been solid activity and execution on content across Twitter, Medium and Discord.\nWhat I think needs improvement in relation to my Responsibilities\n\n1. Continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere.\n\nThe Social Highlights program: I have not explored the social highlights program fully. This still needs attention and I will look at allocating time to it during this contributor time frame.\n\n1:10 post to engagement ratio: This happens, but not as consistently as I would like and I need to clarify certain elements of this. This still needs attention and I will look at allocating time to it as well.\n\nWhile I have not addressed these two elements fully up to this point, as my systems of operations fall into place I foresee time freeing up, and organizing these will be on the top of the list to tackle.\n\n2. Social Engagement:\n\n    I still have to analyze competitors, complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on Twitter. I hope to allocate time to this, depending on urgency and priority.\n\n    While I have created content, it has been part of the ongoing events and affairs of DXdao. I have spent some time thinking about where I can add value in developing additional content, but not taken strong actionable steps yet. I will look to nail down a topic and formulate an actionable plan and system during this period.\n\n3. Growth Marketing:\n\nAgain during this period I only briefly looked at metrics at times to see how things were going during certain times. This needs more time and I will be looking at discussing this more with @KeenanL, especially as this aligns with the DXvoice Budget and KPIs.\nSome thoughts:\n\nI realize now more than ever that things move at lightning speed in web3. I get a sense that things are changing in DXdao. With the increase in developer power, upcoming release of guilds, Arbitrum Odyssey, Carrot v1 and two major conferences ahead to name but a few, it is clear that DXdao is shifting into a higher gear. This is going to bring many opportunities and challenges and I aim to do my part in helping the collective deal with the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities.\n\nI think that as I achieve my goals and fulfill my responsibilities I will be able to provide the communication systems DXdao requires to inform the community in a fashion that is both fun and informative.\nGoals:\n\n    Continue to improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products and services. (By the look of things, this will become a rolling goal as things change so fast, and there will always be something new to learn).\n    Continue clarifying existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities and take them on as my “own”.\n    Get to know contributors that I have not yet met.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nContinue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere.\n\n    The Social Highlights Program: Clarify, update if need be and implement.\n\n    The application of the 1:10 post to engagement ratio: clarify and implement.\n\nSocial Engagement:\n\n    Identify and analyze competitors, complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on Twitter and Discord.\n    Help increase awareness of DXdao and its products, and drive social engagement with the relevant DXdao Twitter accounts.\n    Explore DXdao history and future to assist in developing a content generating strategy to add to mediums deemed acceptable by DXdao.\n\nGrowth Marketing:\n\n    Analyze data and track metrics of tweets to determine what is working and what is not and to optimize tweets according to target audience.\n\nCommunications:\n\n    Assist with ideating and executing campaigns across owned and other media channels as my awareness and knowledge grows.\n\nPrevious proposals:\n\n25.01.2022 - 04.04.2022: 2.5 month Trial period\n05.04.2022 - 30.05.2022\nCompensation:\n\nThis compensation proposal is being submitted in accordance with the current DXdao Worker Guidelines and the current DXdao Pay Structure 1\n\nI have previously stated that I believe my past experience places me within all the levels 1-4, primarily 3 & 4. When starting at DXdao I volunteered to start my contribution at level 3 as a show of good faith, to prove that I have a work ethic in line with that which is expected at DXdao. I have worked the past 4.5 months at that level and after discussion with my squad lead @KeenanL, he agrees that I have delivered on my promises and that I now also more thoroughly fit within the level 4 of the contributor pay structure. So for these reasons and unless there are any objections, I will be moving to the contribution level 4 1 for the foreseeable future.\n\nExperience Level: 4\nMonth one.\n\n    $6,000 (xDAI)\n    $4,000 (DXD)\n    0.1667% (REP)\n\nMonth two.\n\n    $6,000 (xDAI)\n    $4,000 (DXD)\n    0.1667% (REP)\n\nThe full 2 month period.\n\n    $12,000 (xDAI)\n    $8,000 (DXD) to be paid in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff. The vesting contract would be created and funded in the future after 25.07.2022 and use 31.05.2022 as the starting date of the vesting.\n    0.3334% (REP)\n\nThis proposal requests the first month's compensation. REP to be collected along with the second month payment, in the payment request at the end of this contributor period.\n\nBEGIN KEYBASE SALTPACK SIGNED MESSAGE. kXR7VktZdyH7rvq v5weRa0zkZG4Dpb mspHVqgepCOFm4o HjUBdhNGBh7AJ7x p4FCiscYcXz5lcU Gprqa5YjsbQMWDn 0ejYLQcXkmMhvRp HCBNoE4AyY0n1pC XUXwf7PWrYMglAQ dj1Dw5zfCP1h4c5 rPYoGDJrQ3TnbYL Oyf2Ck770i3bTcC oX83oGDhr1G1fMT dWsy.

Meanwhile we received the audit report for Governance 1.5 contracts. The identified issues have now been fixed and the changes are being reaudited.\n\nIn this period I took a lot of time to work on a foundation for the DXgov subgraph implementations. The team is now actively developing a subgraph implementation for Guilds, with the intention of integrating this with  DAVI. I'm also working on an effort to unify all DXgov code repositories into a single monorepo, which will reduce our development time and increase productivity.\n\nDue to Devcon, the team was not available for a few weeks for development. Personally in this period I was also moving to Sweden and was not working. This has been reflected in the proposal as an extension of my contribution period.\n\n**Did well**\n- Supporting DAVI development efforts and collaborating with the team on brainstorming, planning and mobbing sessions.\n- Supporting DAVI deployment and DXdao contracts 1.5 audit fixes.\n- Initiating and structuring the DXgov subgraph and monorepo development efforts, hopefully resulting in faster development cycles.\n- I believe I've improved on my productivity and availability significantly, and will continue to make sure this is the case.\n\n**Improve on**\n- The ongoing struggles around governance and restructuring was taking a toll mentally, so I decided to step back and reduce the time I allocate for governance activities. Going forward I expect to be engaging in governance more.\n\n### Work completed\n\n* Find my completed pull requests for [frontend](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amprasanjith), [contracts](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amprasanjith), [subgraph](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-subgraph) and [monorepo](https://github.com/DXgovernance/davi-monorepo).\n\n### Compensation\n\n* $5600 ($7000 * 0.8) DAI to be sent on the second payment proposal\n* $4000 DXD ($5000 * 0.8) in a vesting contract continuously for three years\n* 0.13336% REP (0.1667% * 0.8), to be sent on the second payment proposal","title":" Madusha - Contributor Proposal [07/09/2022 - 06/11/2022] - Second Half","hash":"QmP2pHuRVnrKC4hynA3PM76UnNSGJjc4Aznk3LJVBKha5w"},"0x738116dfc44ba02a6af95543d863ef003293414939bcac04c683ab6e22b5f8be":{"description":"    \nThis proposal places a 4 WETH order on CowSwap for DXD.

Expected to complete in Q2.\n    Initiated discussions with Ross and Zett to kickstart discussions around SWPR Governance.\n    Having conversations with QA and figuring out scope for test automation.\n    Onboarding more people(Diogo and Paolo) into the Swapr team and helping them to navigate the trial period.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\nSwapr weeklies are becoming better with demos on the features being worked on. This enabled a lot of discussions, feedback and clarification while the development is ongoing and not after it is delivered.\n\n**Things that could be better:**\n\nThere are multiple tasks that are always about 85 to 90% complete and then takes longer time to just hammer it down and ship. I think Swapr would be in a much better place if we focus on completing all the tasks that were initiated instead of picking new ones. One of the possible reason is also that we take tasks too big and dont cut down into smaller releaseable chunks.\n\nI request the following payment for March.\n\n8000 XDAI as stable coin payment. \n0.1666% REP\n6000 USD worth of DXD vested over 3 years and 1 year cliff.","title":"[Etherlabs AB] Payment Proposal [March 2022]","hash":"QmNsKj3Q5NTAD8jWyrbXQgMZ3eMsZL1xtbGopdbmwmjWvx"},"0x7427b0bfaaebc04f917253fa641c021ded395114efabd328d791150945b6dada":{"description":"This proposals:\n\n- approves 50k USDC to the 3pool Curve pool\n- swaps 50k USDC to wxDai on Curve\n- unwraps 50k wxDai to xDai","title":"Swap 50k USDC to xDai","hash":"QmPvKiRLVN3kYTUcH1V2T87vV9AwoQUKK9bdwr18HNR61b"},"0x743d2917b801f4c75efe8b2a4e31e4993dbb7e8e7ef39dff0d12f2b8f8e5e69e":{"description":"\n    \nThis proposal places a 4 WETH order on CowSwap for DXD.

The initiative is to attract interested parties in launching sales on Aqua. Since @Caden has agreed to help with branding and exposure. I believe this will help Aqua gain the community's attraction.~~\n  - Level up on my Solidity skills (thanks to @AugustoL)\n  - Start collaboration on DXvote. This does not mean my focus would divert from Aqua, but I would like to help the initiative should time permit.<sup>[1]</sup>\n  - Be more involved with DXventures with @sky, mainly to learn more about DXdao's portfolio and the BizDev squad<sup>[1]</sup>\n- Responsibilities\n  - Help with the FairSale contracts for Aqua.\n  - Polish outstanding tasks for the Aqua MVP.\n  - Review and study the contracts for potential bugs. I maintain a journal shared with @JohnKelleher.\n  - Help @nico with smart contract bug fixes and testing.\n\n###### Footnote\n[1] These are secondary objectives and outside of the current scope of this proposal.

This was discussed on DAOTalk [here](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-dec-21-jan-22/3702). This proposal pays 11,190 xDai.\n\nWhat I did well:\n\n\n\n* [Governance Q1 Update and Roadmap](https://daotalk.org/t/governance-q1-update-and-roadmap/3805) - this was a presentation I gave on a Friday strategy call that gave a general overview of where we’re going. I think it’s best usecase was as a model for others in preparing their annual reviews.\n* Helped @Mel and contributor ux squad [pass new compensation scheme](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/mainnet/proposal/0xaa3c6d9953d5510a0f014f946e94f03f07a4e5259718e86f07d41d255917e410). I also think I did a good job of providing feedback to others for the contributors reviews as well as the Coordinape notes.\n* DXD Buyback Facilitation along with Fluiddrop. Dave did a great job of managing this through the holidays. I am happy with the consistency of the DXD Trade Volume updates as well as the number of DXD purchases. I also had a forum post in January on [Increasing DXD’s on-chain liquidity](https://daotalk.org/t/increasing-dxds-on-chain-liquidity/3812). This has also been helped by feedback and assistance from DXD holders and the #market-chatter channel\n* Wrote “[DAO Sovereignty](https://governthis.substack.com/p/dao-sovereignty-and-why-its-important?s=r)” for Govern This newsletter. I thought this was a good article that shows what’s unique about DXdao’s governance structure. I also had a great time at the 1Hive Trivia awards and [facilitated the DXD rewards](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-member-balancer-for-1hive-trivia-awards/3830)\n\nWhat I did okay\n\n\n\n* [Expenses](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_A7hiVumUi2eStT-JlcPF-M2OEjiCNdqW9J9_3zU4sk/edit?usp=sharing) - not sure if this should be included in this worker period as I just finished [presenting it last Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKYPg8G2bFY&t=497s), but it’s also why I have not claimed the funds from this worker proposal. I’m happy with the model or system that is now created, but it took way too long. I could have done a better job of including Dave/Ally earlier, but it felt easier to just do it all first myself. We are now working on a more sustainable system.\n* “Reading Period” I did some reading and actually did make major progress on the hardware front (Caney Fork is now a Gnosis Beacon Chain validator!). Still, I felt a little too engaged and think it beneficial to have actual vacation so something distracts your mind.\n* [Helped Sky coordinate efforts](https://daotalk.org/t/discussion-post-proposal-to-increase-dxdao-s-capital-in-swapr-on-gnosis-chain/3786/4) to increase DXdao’s liquidity in Swapr. The funds were transferred but still working through some issues on liquidity provisioning through the relayer.\n\nWhat I did not do okay at\n\n\n\n* Timing. This is late as is my next proposal. The reason is because I try to finish something before submitting the next one. This motivates me to produce but it’s not a great way for everyone to communicate their work load. I should be more realistic in my original worker proposal\n* There were a lot of deliverable goals that were missed. These were mostly governance strategy/coordination efforts around the DXD token and REP syncing. These are important but require community buy-in and it’s tough to move forward with these while other items are more pressing. I still believe these are big long-term problems that need to be addressed and hope to continue to try and push the conversation forward.\n\nPayments and logistics:\n\n\n\n* Total payment in this proposal: $11,190\n* Work period: Dec 1, 2021 - Jan 31, 2021\n* Month 1 (60% work commitment at Level 5 at old compensation structure)\n    * $4,800 xDai\n    * Number of DXD vested for 2 years with 1 year cliff 4.27 (using Coingecko ATH of $844) on 12/1/2021\n* Month 2 (71% commitment at Level 8 in new compensation structure)\n    * $6,390 xDai\n    * Number of DXD vested for 3 years with 1 year cliff 12.89 (using avg DXD price of $523) on 1/1/2022\n* No REP requested as CaneyFork.eth has already reached 4% max on mainnet\n\n\n\nThe scope of work covers the following squads:\n\n\n\n* Governance 50%\n* DXvoice 30%\n* Contributor UX 10%\n* Ecosystem development and security 10%\n\n\n\n## Past Worker proposals\n\n2020\n\n\n\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [July/August]](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-governance-biz-dev-and-content-focused-rep-request/1775)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [August/September]](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-governance-biz-dev-and-community-request-for-worker-compensation/1888)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [October/November]](https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-caney-fork/2152)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [December/January]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-12-1-1-31/2491)\n\n2021\n\n\n\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [February/March]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-feb-march-2021/2661)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [April/May]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-apr-may-2021/2805)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [June/July]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-june-july-2021-draft/2999)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [August/September]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-aug-sept-2021-draft/3167)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [October/November] ](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-oct-nov-2021/3418)","title":"Caney Fork Proposal & Payout Dec '21 & Jan '22","hash":"QmU1c89ziFQmXLYQbYSdqSckPxU2gx4rPBnW4crNKaBVTs"},"0x74d20b4c137532658797ecb9462abd87ca529c7b98d6d2b3943e332babe01714":{"description":"This proposal calls DXdao's Reality.eth arbitrator to set the final answer for the Carrot KPI token with question id `0xaa79603608b0afd28493637164a684361723674fb6aa1ca250dc819351b323dd`.

I think think that the 40 workable day//8 week contract period is stronger due to the flexibility it provides; transitioning to 40d resulted in quite a significant stress reduction considering the consistency of payments/working days giving more work-life flexibility, and lifted a lot of weight off surrounding accounting/taxes. Contributor Experience has stated that contributors should all get back to the original bi-monthly cadence, which this proposal has been submitted under, but I would highly suggest that it reconsider its stance, even if reductions to salary figures needed to accompany it. Would love to elaborate further on the next Contributor UX meetings!\n\n## Reflection on previous proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [May - June](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-contributor-proposal-for-05-2022-to-06-2022/4164), what I think I did well includes:\n\n- **Community Growth** - The community has been growing at a respectable pace despite overarching market conditions. Community calls remain as the leading DXdao call for attendance, lots of new faces joining in on daily conversations through our community channels and more. Excited to continue bolstering these efforts.\n\n- **Content Quality** - Across the multitude of DXvoice initiatives, the quality level of our content has increased dramatically - of course, over the past year or so, but seemingly more-so within the previous months. Between articles, social media content, design, and everything in-between DXvoice is in an incredible condition. Coordinating the efforts of the squad has been a privilege. \n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **Public Figure** - I've spoken several times about wanting to project my personal voice and opinions outward more - but have yet to find a rhythm or audience that sticks. Repetition is key here; alongside general community efforts I aim to put myself out there more - even if only steps at a time. _Someone_ needs to communicate the importance of decentralization.\n\n- **SWPR Emissions Targets** - Due to general insanity as of late, adjustments to individual pairs in the SWPR emissions schedule have gone by the wayside. This was rectified in the end of the period (prepared mid June for early July target) with some large adjustments to both Gnosis Chain and Arbitrum. Going forward, I will be leading discussions into the future of SWPR emissions and what it means for the protocol - as Swapr is nearing on completion of its first year of liq mining. \n\n## Goals/Responsibilities:\n\n**[65%] DXvoice Coordination and Execution**\n\n* Lead DXdao’s “DXvoice” squad\n  * Organize, run, and manage various initiatives including but not limited to squad calls, marketing processes, community calls, events, content coordination, etc…\n  * Explore the potential for DXvoice to further become a more independent entity with its own goals.

Full-time with 40 workable days/2 months\n\n**Position:** DXvoice coordinator, Community Leader, Internal Operations and Documentation\n\n**Background:** \n\nThe previous contribution period was busy and rewarding, including the opportunity to shill DXdao like we never have before. ETHdenver was an incredible event and I believe we learned some important things about the market and truly believe our brand has begun cracking the surface of the greater ecosystem. You can get more background on ETHdenver related findings here: https://daotalk.org/t/keenans-ethdenver-thoughts-and-personal-outlook/3933\n\nI moved this proposal ahead a day to account for some reduced time the final week of the previous proposal. This is simply to make accounting easier for both myself and DXdao. I worked partially Feb 24th and 25th, while working fully on Feb 28th (despite not reflected in either proposal).\n\n## Reflection on previous proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [January - February](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-contributor-proposal-for-01-2022-to-03-2022/3832), what I think I did well includes:\n\n- **Community and Brand** - This period more-so than ever before included branching DXdao into the wider ecosystem. This was accomplished through [interviews](https://twitter.com/KeenanLukeCCC/status/1485712306147258368), [fun trivia games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMNNm65P4IA), impressive ETHdenver merch, and much more. The network effects are becoming apparent, with more and more active crypto participants becoming familiar with DXdao and its vision.\n\n- **Landing pages/DXdocs** - Both the DXdao and Swapr landing pages are now live to high initial praise. The Swapr landing page is notable since its an experiment in combining a traditional landing page dapp separation. DXdocs v1.1.0 also released, and although it still needs lots of work, DXdao's information resource got much, much deeper.\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **DXdao Selling/Focal** - I shed some light on this in my ETHdenver outlook post. I think I should focus more time on solidifying what this focal point is, and how we can continue to capitalize on this through objective and monitorable KPI's. More context: https://daotalk.org/t/keenans-ethdenver-thoughts-and-personal-outlook/3933#dxdao-needs-to-discuss-and-clarify-its-focal-selling-point-5\n\n- **Swapr farming organization** - Coordination of the previous SWPR farming epoch became very difficult when considering creation of Carrot campaigns and contentious opinions on use of GNO rewards. Going forward, I'd like to ensure that these campaigns are both live in the UI at least a week before, and created through DXdao governance on Gnosis Chain rather than the multi-chain multi-sig where possible. \n\n## Compensation:\n\nThe previous proposal reflected an adjustment to the updated contributor guidelines.

During ETH Paris I had a chance to learn about DxDao from Zett and Venky which eventually lead me to contributing to Swapr.\n\nI’m a full stack developer with 5 years of commercial experience (mostly software house & banking industry) with wide tech stack, from which most relevant to Swapr are React, Nodejs, Typescript, CI/CD, Docker, Solidity, Web3 libs (hardhat, ethers, ethersproject) and some Graph Protocol (I’ll skip irrelevant tech like Google Cloud, AWS, SQL, etc.).\n\nAs some of you may already know, due to legal obligations that I have I need to remain anonymous until I feel comfortable with quitting my day job and going full-time. Even though I can see that full-time contributors in DxDao are comfortable with working (and earning) fully on-chain, I still want to see whether this form of employment is for me and - what’s most important - whether I belong here. I’m aware that this situation may be uncomfortable with some of you but I also hope that all perks that come with working in DeFi (including privacy) are not only buzzwords. Having this opportunity I’d like to thank Adam, Venky & Zett for giving me benefit of doubt by allowing me to contribute in this way.\n\nTimeframe:\n\n1 month\nStarting at 15th of August\n\nScope:\n\nI assisted Adam on Expeditions Event implementation (API & UI) by introducing swagger docs that are consumend by front-end, doing reviews and fixing bugs. I made some suggestions on how ‘gamification’ user experience may be improved and I’m more than happy to participate in further discussions regarding the process.\n\nWhile working on front-end I fixed an issue with undesired logs coming from external lib that spammed the console which I believe will make devs life easier.\n\nMy next assignment is to work on Token Picker redesign & refactor. After I’m done I’m planning to go throught the open issues in a Github and close as much as I can before I’m assigned to new task.\n\nMy thoughts so far:\nDuring this trial month I’ve managed to learn a lot about how Swapr ecosystem works. I’m finding myself really well in the codebase and I don’t need much explanation of how things work (Adam - I hope you agree!). I still need to learn more about ecoRouter and ecoBridge because it’s not entirely clear to me how they work, that’s why I hope I’ll have opportunity to contribute in these areas (learn by coding).\nI can see that there’s an effort to make use of Storybook but so far not much has been done. I have previous experience with working with this lib so I’ll be happy to help with migrating UI components to it.\nPersonally I found out that doing day job + part time contributing is not so easy as I thought it would be. After month of contributing I think I found my pace and settled routine that will keep me being productive.

You can see the last payout to Level K drafted here: [Level K Draft Worker Payout Proposal for 3/2021-4/2021](https://daotalk.org/t/level-k-draft-worker-payout-proposal-for-3-2021-4-2021/2899) My only excuse is that things have been incredibly busy and writing this up has seemed in a constant state of not being quite at the top of the todo list. Happy to take a 5% penalty or whatever the new policy may be on late worker proposals.\n\n**Recap of Work**\n\n*Product and Development*\n\n- Organized weekly dev call.\n\n- Coordinated second full audit of Swapr Farming contracts, an initial review of the Mesa (now Aqua) smart contracts, and an audit of the Conditional Token KPI contracts\n \n- Coordinated security monitoring efforts\n \n- Supported Omen architecture review with Kaden and the rest of Omen Squad, addressing blockers with liquidity mining and the Omen FPMM as well as planning around handling code debt\n \n- Supported Swapr Farming testing and launch\n \n- Liaised with Agave about potential collaborations in the use of KPI tokens\n \n- Technical support of treasury diversification, Swapr liquidity deposits, and DXD buyback\n \n- Troubleshooting and coordinating response to Subgraph outtages on Alchemy and Swapr\n \n- Supported coordination with Arbitrum on deployment to their Arbitrum One mainnet Beta\n \n- Supported onboarding of new devs and establishing engagements with ETHworks, Space Inch, and Hunter Design\n\n*Community Building*\n\n- Provide support across squads as well as in public communications channels, especially on high level technical questions\n\n- Gave a talk at 0xHack\n \n- Worked with Hats in support of setting up a DXdao-Hats partnership\n \n- Attended meetings in support of DXdao - Radicle collaboration\n \n- Helped recruit and onboard @Caden to the marketing squad\n \n\n**Reflections**\n\n- I feel like I am still spread a bit thin and would like to focus more on strengthening the development and design capacity of the squads. Hoping to gain more confidence in being able to step back from more general support across the board and to be able to focus more on DXdao dev capabilities.\n\n- DAOs have been getting more discussion in crypto communities and I think I should be stepping up my contributions to bring DXdao into the conversation. Would like to focus more on writing in the future.\n\n- Need to find more time for documentation. I have fallen a bit behind on this front.\n\n\n**Compensation**\n\nLevel K has already received the max amount of REP. According to the guidelines for a DXdao worker with expert level experience and a commitment level of 5, total compensation is $8,000 in stablecoins or ETH and $6,000 worth of DXD per month.\n\n- 16000 USD to be paid in USDC (minus any applicable penalty for late subimssion), to be paid in this proposal\n- 12000 USD to be paid in DXD vesting over 24 months with a 12 month cliff, based on the all time high price of DXD at time of vesting/lockup contract creation or at time a proposal passes specifying the claim. The vesting/lockup contract would be created and funded at or after final payment and use 07/01/2021 as the starting date of the vesting.","title":"Level K Worker Proposal  and Payout 5/2021 - 6/2021 (LATE)","hash":"QmNMDGykU42AQ9GU3nR4ohYiCQkYvpKbPWpnbWwgqQqeiJ"},"0x78485b1e586ed9065a3cb4dd211149e3a57c221e6d92a79e8ceecfd4383ae9c8":{"description":"* Background:\n  * I onboarded on Carrot to help the team ship the new version\n  * Before I had been working at Swapr, where I implemented features, UI and code improvements and bug fixes.\n  * Here is a list of my previous PRs:\n    * [Carrot Dapp](https://github.com/carrot-kpi/frontend-monorepo/pulls/Diogomartf)\n    * [Swapr-dapp](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adiogomartf+sort%3Aupdated-desc+)\n* Timeframe:\n  * 1 month at 80% from full-time\n     * I'm increasing my time commitment from 60% to 80%.\n* Proposed Scope of Contribution:\n  * Goals:\n    * Help them team ship Carrot v2 \n    * Help to create a design system\n  * Responsibilities:\n    * Collaborate with Carrot dev team on to build the new app.\n    * Do code reviews.\n    * Work closely with designers to ensure quality.\n* Compensation:\n  * Experience Level: 4\n  * Time commitment: 1 month at 80% full-time (less 5 days I will take off)\n  * Salary for 1 month of work:\n    * Month 1\n      * DAI: $3600  | $4800 ($6000 * 80%) - $1200 (5 days off (5 / 20 * $4800) \n      * DXD: $3200 ($4000 * 80%), vested for 3 years with a 1 year cliff starting at 02 December 2022\n      * REP: 0.13336 (0.1667 * 80% )\n* Work Experience:\n   * [Contributor Proposal 10/10/2022 - 02/12/2022](https://daotalk.org/t/diogo-contributor-proposal-10-10-2022-02-12-2022/4645)\n       * [Retrospective](https://daotalk.org/t/diogo-contributor-proposal-10-10-2022-02-12-2022/4645/2?u=diogo)\n   * [Contributor Proposal 15/08/2022 - 07/10/2022](https://daotalk.org/t/diogo-contributor-proposal-15-08-22-07-10-22/4458/4)\n      *  [Retrospective](https://daotalk.org/t/diogo-contributor-proposal-15-08-22-07-10-22/4458/4?u=diogo)\n   * [Contributor Proposal 20/06/2022-12/08/2022](https://daotalk.org/t/diogo-ferreira-contributor-proposal-20-june-2022-12-august-2022/4312/5)\n     * [Retrospective](https://daotalk.org/t/diogo-ferreira-contributor-proposal-20-june-2022-12-august-2022/4312/5?u=diogo)\n   * [Contributor Proposal 16/04/2022-16/06/2022](https://daotalk.org/t/diogo-contributor-proposal-16-04-2022-16-06-2022/4156)\n     * [Retrospective](https://daotalk.org/t/diogo-contributor-proposal-16-04-2022-16-06-2022/4156/2?u=diogo) \n  * [Contributor Proposal 04/04/2022- 5/06/2022 ](https://daotalk.org/t/diogo-ferreira-contributor-proposal-4-04-2022-15-04-2022/4096)","title":" Diogo Contributor proposal [05/12/2022 - 30-12-2022]","hash":"QmZBGzxe47hSoTCxsa1zCuJvTZatriGjBLABjGSKGdkpVU"},"0x78670cc0ca8e08fd170816a5f6f499de752b50482e770d1bbe144ffbabc9ce7d":{"description":"## Timeframe:\n\n31/11/2022-31/12/2022, 1 month\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nMostly swapr-dapp and swapr-sdk related tasks which will focus on fixing bugs and maintaining the platform.

We also love the branding!\n- **Content quality** - Once again I am reiterating the increased quality of content for both DXdao and its products. The upcoming landing pages and explainer videos should set a bar we have yet to reach in the past, and it has the whole team extremely excited. More concise scheduling for socials, increased outreach for Infinite drawing in a healthier group of accepted hackers, consistent Discord improvements to UX and security, etc...\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **DXvoice Organization/Leadership** - For an extended period of time I have been discussing/working on better documentation, organization and prioritization flows for DXvoice. Until this point, much of the coordination has happened simply through word of mouth or in notes, which is not scalable. This needs to be expedited. \n\n-  **DXdocs and general documentation activity/participation** - DXdocs continues to fall to the wayside, with other initiatives taking precedence. This is unsustainable, and should have a more formalized release schedule with group participation to keep information both relevant and up to date. The following deliverables from my previous period, although at a very low %, were not completed to my standards.\n\n> - Create and format associated text, run the [DXdocs] project board and ensure relevant deadlines are met.\n> - Coordinate documentation resources from all active DXdao products and squad\n\n## Goals/Responsibilities:\n\n**[65%] DXvoice Coordination and Execution**\n\n* Lead DXdao’s “DXvoice” squad\n  * Organize, run, and manage various initiatives including but not limited to squad calls, marketing processes, community calls, events, content coordination, etc…\n  * Explore potential for DXvoice to further become a more independent entity with its own goals.\n  * Coordinate DXvoice multi-sig execution\n    * Continue to monitor and utilize annual expenditure sheet\n* Keep third party representation of the DXdao brand consistent where possible\n  * Coingecko, CMC, BF, articles, etc…\n* Continue to content push schedule\n  * Encourage third party involvement where feasible\n* Move forward as a public figure for the DXdao Community\n* Continue creation and curation of DXdao Discord servers and the related initiatives\n  * Discord Quarterly REP boosts, Infinite Discord, etc\n* Better integrate squads into content processes to ensure further clarity to both teams\n* Write, Edit, and format content including announcements, MIR, social threads, etc…\n* Continue to work alongside design to build out landing pages and other UX;\n* Continue to manage and automate inflow\n  * User support, Bizdev opportunities, social media inflow, etc…\n* Further guide onboarding of new DXvoice contributors\n\n**[10%] Swapr and Carrot**\n\n* Reflect and explore upon [SWPR tokenomics](https://daotalk.org/t/swpr-token-and-swapr-guild/3118)\n    * Identify and guide a potential SWPR tokenomics upgrade\n* Lead discussions surrounding the future of SWPR emissions, our options and what they mean for the protocol\n* Guide the creation and deployment of monthly Carrot campaign proposals and call data\n* Actively manage and refine SWPR emission strategy\n* Guide the creation and deployment of monthly SWPR emissions proposals and call data\n* Communicate with partner projects and prospective partners surrounding emission schedule\n* Help push any Carrot front-end changes including introduction of new campaigns\n* **I expect these responsibilities to wind down in light of SWPR emissions ending, and will reallocate this time back into DXvoice or Governance depending on the outcome of recent proposals.**\n\n**[5%] Governance**\n\n* Provide an alternative [format for DXdao's restructuring](https://daotalk.org/t/restructuring-and-refocus-an-alternative-proposal/4522) -- guide proposal facets\n  * *If no leadership emerges surrounding the execution of the format, and provided it passes,* assist in communicating and coordinating between REP and DXD holders to identify an equitable path to success for both parties.\n\n**[5%] Contributor Experience**\n\n* Continue to assist with the onboarding process\n* Help address contributor concerns\n* Assist squad with information as needed and relevant resources\n* Help maintain Open Positions document and Bounties, and export to DXdocs\n\n**[5%] DXdocs**\n\n* Continue to lead the [DXdocs effort ](https://dxdocs.eth.link/).

The new year is always a time for retrospect and it’s pretty cool that it closely coincides with this proposal. It gives me an opportunity to look a little further back.\n\nTuesday 25.01.2022 was the first day that I officially started at DXdao. Exactly a year later will be the last day of this proposal. I remember driving home the Monday before. It was snowing a lot so it was really slow-going home. I was listening to the Bizdev call that had just started and was about 5 minutes away from home when I heard Eylon say “we have a new member introduction tonight, Wayne, who we will hear from in a few moments’'!\n\nI tell you, I panicked! My heart rate jumped by like 30 beats per minute because I was not prepared at all and here I am in a snowstorm and naturally not wanting to make a bad impression I just stopped in the middle of the road, threw on my hazards and grabbed the phone. Luckily it was a quite road! To this day I don’t remember what I said, but I do remember how exhilarating it felt to finally be starting my DAO journey. I can be a sentimental old fool and could go on and on about the memories, but I am going to contain myself and just say that I have loved it and thank you all very much. People and the way they interact and coordinate has always fascinated me and being part of the DAO has been one of my most eye-opening journeys yet. I know we have our challenges, but I have seen the people I am here with now and I am betting we are going to figure it out.\nWith DEVCon and the retreat in the rear view mirror, I find two things stay with me from that time. Both very prominent and important to the future of the DAO.\n\nThe first is our vision, “Enable Community Freedom”. This is such a powerful vision and what makes it more so is that it came from all of us, without forcing it. It just came out! I said it in my recap and I am going to say it again here, this is nothing short of amazing. What I truly love is that I can already see it working its magic.\n\nThe second one is communication. I am sure we have all heard it at one time or another that communication is the key to a healthy relationship. I guess growing up in an environment where communication was either toxic or non-existent, made me a stickler for it, especially here in my old age. I would go one step further and say that healthy communication is key to having a healthy relationship. I look forward to seeing how we tackle this. Bound to be interesting times.\n\nI will keep mentioning this because I think it is an important element for us to realize to create a healthy team environment. I think the DXdao’s contributors are an amazing group of individuals. I feel privileged to be around you all and to have this opportunity to learn from you.\n\nThank you all once again and as always, I welcome any feedback, notes or criticism. This post will be on the forum until 21.11.2022, when it will go on chain for voting to conclude on 26.11.2022.\n\n**Role:**\nSocial Media and Community Growth Contributor\n\n**Time frame:**\n2 Month Period - 26.11.2022 - 25.01.2023 (40 hours/week)\n\n**Reflection on goals and responsibilities:**\n\n*1. Improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products*\n\nMy knowledge of all things DXdao and DAOs in general is constantly growing and I am loving how this is starting to fall into place for me. Even though I still have plenty to learn (and only a fool thinks he knows everything), I do now think I have sufficient knowledge that I can talk freely about DXdao’s governance, Swapr, Carrot and even though not a DXdao product, Nimi. I am not sure how we would classify Infinite, but I have also gained a solid understanding of what it takes to host and promote a hackathon.\n\nI have made a point of spending more time interacting with different contributors from different products and squads to get a better understanding of their products. I have also made a point of creating more content surrounding these products which further aids my learning about them. I have really been enjoying this and since our return from Colombia we have been pushing to create solid content around Swapr.\n\nI have also participated in DAVI and Carrot testing which has been great for a more thorough understanding of how they work and I look forward to more of this. It has been fun working with the devs more directly and not being so distant from each other.\n\n*2. Continue clarifying existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities and take them on as my “own”.*\n\nThis continues to happen and I most likely will need to take on more as time goes by. I feel that I have become proactive in this area, especially around recurring operational responsibilities. With regards to new initiatives, if it requires my involvement I make a point of being a reliable team member who can be counted on. As previously stated, this is an ever evolving activity and with changes on the horizon with regards to the Restructuring and Refocus drive, I will remain vigilant in maintaining this level of commitment and output in helping design and create new systems of operations. This is an exciting time for the DAO and I am happy to be a part of these changes.\n\n*3. Get to know the remaining key contributors that I have not yet met.*\n\nWhat can a man say here other than, meeting everyone in Colombia was absolutely fantastic! I loved, loved, loved the retreat! (not the damn mosquitoes). I enjoyed all the jokes, laughter and meals together. I really had such a lot of fun getting to know you all better, I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would even endure the 30 hours of traveling, but I think I would draw the line at a mosquito heavy location. Maybe.\n\nBeing in such close proximity and even for such a short period of time was amazing and just what the DAOctor ordered. It gave me insights and understanding that had been slightly missing for me. I look forward to the next time, whenever that might be.\n\n**What I think I did well in relation to my Responsibilities:**\n\n*1. Continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere:*\n\nOctober was dominated by Infinite, Devcon and the retreat. Twitter time was predominantly over the Infinite period and there was a lot of engagement during that time. Over Devcon and since we have returned it has been more sporadic, focusing mainly on highlighting existing information and products.\n\nI will continue to make Twitter a focal point and continue the 1:10 post to engagement ratio activity.There was a lot of discussion with me at the retreat about taking the Twitter accounts in a more “personal and less stiff” direction. This has been discussed with Keenan and will be a point of discussion in the future.\n\nThe cryptoverse and Twitter has gone and is still going through some crazy times and it will be interesting to see where things go from here.\n\n*2. Communications:*\n\nI continue to get better at creating content for DXdao and also in doing so on a more consistent basis. I made it a point during this proposal period to continue helping in content creation. Also in working with more contributors to open up more avenues of content creation and feedback. Unfortunately some articles in backlog never made it out, but I guess that is par for the course. Sometimes market conditions shift priorities and dictate what needs to be published. Swapr content is front and center right now, especially with Arbitrum Odyssey on the horizon. This is a great opportunity for Swapr and we are working on pushing as much info as possible (within reason of coure). As DAVI becomes more mainstream and we get ready to open it up to the world for public testing, I am certain that it will also produce great opportunities for content.\n\nThis area is very exciting for me. With the passing of the second stage “Restructuring and Refocus” which solidified the DXdao vision as “Enable Community Freedom” I see many opportunities for us to communicate and in a more unified way. It is going to be an exciting time.\n\n*3. Time Management:*\n\nI got this under control to a large degree. I no longer spend an unreasonable amount of time in front of the computer. I have focused my time on certain activity windows depending on my colleagues’ activity windows in such a manner that there is overlap and opportunity for communication, but not to the degree that I am heading to bed as the sun rises. I feel more refreshed and not so haggard. With this improved time management I also have more time with my family.\n\n**What I think needs improvement in relation to my Responsibilities**\n\n*1. Participation:*\n\nDuring the retreat, I recognized that participation in communication and the happenings of the DAO by the contributors was one of the key topics. Since joining the DAO I have taken a very reserved position in participating in ongoing conversations and have not been a regular participant in conversations. I will aim to rectify this and participate where I see my experience and knowledge can add value to the situation.\n\n*2. Social Engagement:*\n\nI am still struggling to keep up with this especially because we had so many great representations over the last few weeks. As I said before, I really think it is important to highlight our contributors’ engagement with the greater web3 community. It is important from the perspective that it keeps DXdao in the minds of the community. Since we have entered a stage now where we are primarily focusing on existing achievements I will make a point to catch up on this in the coming two months. There are a lot of very important items to cover and I hope to see them out sooner rather than later.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n1. Continue to improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products and services.\n2. Maintain existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities.\n3. Continue to contribute to the DXvoice squad in a flexible manner which adds value to the squad and to the greater DAO.\n4. Participate in discussion surrounding areas of operation to which I can add value.\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**Continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere:**\n\n- Devise relevant Twitter Campaigns with relevant parties.\n- Maintain a constant information stream relevant to the product and its users.\n\n**Social Engagement:**\n\n- Help increase awareness of DXdao and its products, and drive social engagement with the relevant DXdao Twitter accounts.\n- Continue to assist in generating content supporting the activities of the DAO to add to the relevant mediums deemed acceptable by DXdao.\n- Identify and analyze competitors, complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on Twitter and Discord.\n\n**Growth Marketing:**\n\n- Analyze data and track metrics of tweets to determine what is working, what is not, and to optimize tweets according to the target audience.\n\n**Communications:**\n\n- Assist with ideating and executing campaigns across owned and other media channels, as needed.\n\nPrevious proposals:\n\n[25.01.2022 - 04.04.2022: 2.5 month Trial period](https://daotalk.org/t/waynes-worker-proposal-trial-period-late-jan-2022-to-early-april-2022/3939/7)\n\n[05.04.2022 - 30.05.2022](https://daotalk.org/t/waynes-worker-proposal-early-april-2022-late-may-2022/4029#what-i-think-needs-improvement-5)\n\n[31.05.2022 - 25.07.2022](https://daotalk.org/t/waynes-worker-proposal-early-june-2022-late-july-2022/4205)\n\n[26.07.2022 - 25.09.2022](https://daotalk.org/t/wayne-s-worker-proposal-late-july-2022-late-sep-2022/4358)\n\n[26.09.2022 - 25.11.2022](https://daotalk.org/t/wayne-s-worker-proposal-26-09-2022-25-11-2022/4537)\n\nDevcon:\nI am also claiming the tax that I had to pay for my hotel in Bogotá, $476. I needed a visa for Colombia and the hotel explained that the visa I was on did not allow for tax exemption. I increased my stay to make sure that I was in Colombia ahead of time to help with the Infinite hackathon and have paid for those two days myself, $452. Per the Colombia Stipend proposal, extra costs needed to be cleared by Melanie and I discussed this with her and she confirmed this is ok.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\nThis compensation proposal is being submitted in accordance with the current [DXdao Worker Guidelines](https://dxdocs.eth.link/docs/ContributorHub/contributor-onboarding/) and the current [DXdao Pay Structure](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/xdai/proposal/0xd891621300fb5cd46a7962787f4d2fa85998bfb5524aae4b1784a620c562fdae)\n\n**Experience Level: 4**\n\nMonth one.\n\n- $6,000 (6000xDAI)\n- $4,000 (DXD)\n- 0.1667% (REP)\n\nMonth two.\n\n- $6,000 (6000xDAI)\n- $4,000 (DXD)\n- 0.1667% (REP)\n\nThe full 2 month period.\n\n- $12,000 (xDAI)\n- $8,000 (DXD) to be paid in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff.\n-  0.3334% (REP) To be claimed at the end of this worker proposal.\n\n**These services are provided through DevX AG and the compensation claim will be done on a seperate proposal executing to the DevX wallet.**\n\nThis proposal will mint the REP and claim the Devcon reimburesement.\n\n","title":"Wayne’s Worker Proposal: 26.11.2022 - 25.01.2023","hash":"QmfYKadwPZpcqURWqW1n6U1iaDc188BVeEgnM6AoRLPzs8"},"0x7bf8e12a45c73e60276a6f27554d446ebae755d0258a326d2d7d75122f17326a":{"description":"This will change the Swapr xDai fee on the DAOhaus and WETH pair to 0.5%.","title":"Set Swap Fee on HAUS-WETH pair to 0.5%","hash":"QmYm5zE2fiioZBJwW73NCQXLtiUt8Sg3Gc6SjzWWtp6DiD"},"0x7c1593827d4c6e4478d49dac40e336977e9ba11dfaad74f803c07d9ad0fe311b":{"description":"This outlines a proposal for a stipend for DXdao’s contributors participating in the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris, France.

Between exciting DXvoice initiatives, Devcon, DXretreat 2022 and the restructuring of our organization, 0xKLOM.eth has been around all things DXdao.\n\nLeading restructuring efforts was an unexpected highlight of the previous period. I was unhappy with the direction and state of organizational discussions and felt like if I had not stepped in, nobody would. At this stage, the restructuring feels to be in an incredible place. Toxicity has shifted to open discussion, and everything is feeling incredibly transparent. It also came at a great time, as DXvoice finalized its preparations for Bogota events, and SWPR emissions winded down.\n\nHowever, its not been without its toll; I have been really struggling in my personal life due to my inability to disconnect and my desire to be available all throughout the day (and night when insomnia is around...) I need to focus on bettering myself and stop compiling excess stress where possible, as it has led to serious health problems recently. As such I'll be trying to condone to a contribution window for this coming period.\n\n***0xKLOM.eth will be contributing between 1600 - 2400 UTC each day on this proposal (adjusted for any necessary calls) and trying to remain disconnected outside of this window.*** \n\n0xKLOM.eth has a few forum posts worth checking out from this last period:\n\n- [Infinite Genesis Community Call [2022-09-30]](https://daotalk.org/t/infinite-genesis-community-call-2022-09-30/4576)\n- [Restructuring and Refocus | Phase 1: Low Hanging Fruit](https://daotalk.org/t/restructuring-and-refocus-phase-1-low-hanging-fruit/4551)\n- [Restructuring and Refocus | Phase 2: Accountability, Access, Anatomy (Structure)](https://daotalk.org/t/restructuring-and-refocus-phase-2-accountability-access-anatomy-structure/4655)\n- [The Future of SWPR Emissions](https://daotalk.org/t/the-future-of-swpr-emissions/4572)\n- [0xKLOM.eth’s Colombia Thoughts](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eths-colombia-thoughts/4652)\n- [DXdao Community Call Relaunch and Scheduling](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-community-call-relaunch-and-scheduling/4641)\n\n## Reflection on previous proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [September to November](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-contributor-proposal-for-09-2022-to-10-2022/4536), what I think I did well includes:\n\n- **Restructuring** - 0xKLOM.eth has committed to various avenues of restructuring discussions, including forum threads, calls and key presentations/discussions at DXretreat 2022. I couldn't be happier with the results thus far, with DXdao accomplishing a signal of its problems, a solution to reach them, and various large-scale discussions about the direction to point surrounding product and organization.\n- **General Content and DXvoice Strategy** - Although communication of goals, internally and externally, still requires additional work, general DXvoice output has increased dramatically yet again, with a variety of product-specific initiatives reaching an impressive state. I've spent lots of time thinking about DXvoice's future as an squad, how it can operate independently while integrating far earlier into product lifecycle, and the possibility of merging Bizdev operations under one blanket voice. Keep an eye out for a DXvoice presentation within the coming week surrounding operational inefficiencies and how DXdao should approach non-technical strategy.\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n-  **Operation Decentralization** - Although an increased focus on restructuring and general governance initiatives had minimal impact on my regular responsibilities, one place it DID was with Operation Decentralization. Colombia-related content and timelined restructuring proposals continued to move this priority down. I am aiming to solve this through informal scheduling and community call relaunch, granting additional windows for the initiative.\n\n- **Community Presence** - The last period presented a large challenge for the community. General camaraderie itself is seriously diminished when discussions are consistently high-stakes and confrontational. Including the community call relaunch, there is still much to be done on the community side of DXdao and its products. I am looking to share some approaches to this alongside the coming DXvoice presentation.\n\n## Goals/Responsibilities:\n\n**[60%] DXvoice Coordination and Execution**\n\n* Lead DXdao’s “DXvoice” squad\n  * Organize, run, and manage various initiatives including but not limited to squad calls, marketing processes, community calls, events, content coordination, etc…\n  * Explore potential for DXvoice to further become a more independent entity with its own goals.\n  * Coordinate DXvoice multi-sig execution\n    * Continue to monitor and utilize annual expenditure sheet\n  * Formally integrate and expand upon operational processes\n    * Set intra-squad accountability and deadlines ahead of squad budgeting\n  * Create process for stronger internal and external communication\n    * Prevent situations where DXvoice works on something that is depreciated before launching\n* Keep third party representation of the DXdao brand consistent where possible\n  * Coingecko, CMC, BF, articles, etc…\n* Continue to explore content push schedule\n  * Encourage third-party involvement where feasible\n* Move forward as a public figure for the DXdao Community\n* Continue creation and curation of DXdao Discord servers and the related initiatives\n  * Discord Quarterly REP boosts, etc\n* Write, Edit, and format content, including announcements, MIR, social threads, etc…\n* Continue to work alongside design to build out landing pages and other UX;\n* Continue to manage and automate inflow\n  * User support, Bizdev opportunities, social media inflow, etc…\n* Explore external opportunities and partnerships to propagate DXdao mission\n\n**[15%] Governance**\n\n* Continue to [lead discussions surrounding the restructuring of DXdao](https://daotalk.org/t/restructuring-and-refocus-an-alternative-proposal/4522)\n  * Further assist in communicating and coordinating between REP and DXD holders to identify an equitable path to success for both parties.\n* Collect and display all relevant information required to dictate future restructuring proposals\n* Further guide the integration of DXD holder voice into DXdao governance ahead of Governance 2.0\n\n**[5%] Swapr and Carrot**\n\n* Continue to lead [SWPR tokenomics and emissions](https://daotalk.org/t/the-future-of-swpr-emissions/4572) discussion as needed\n    * Identify and guide a potential SWPR tokenomics upgrade\n    * Guide future of SWPR emissions and discussion avenues\n* Help push any Carrot front-end changes, including the introduction of new campaigns\n* Schedule and guide resolution process for DXdao deployed campaigns\n\n**[5%] Contributor Experience**\n\n* Continue to assist with the onboarding process\n* Help address contributor concerns\n* Assist squad with information as needed and relevant resources\n* Help maintain Open Positions document and Bounties, and export to DXdocs\n\n**[5%] DXdocs**\n\n* Continue to lead the [DXdocs effort ](https://dxdocs.eth.link/).

I had very nice conversations there and continued talking to them during the next two days at Liscon. Everyone was really welcoming to me and I was looking for a DAO to join to expand my skill set which made a good match.\n\nDuring my studies I worked on several smaller full-stack web applications. I mostly worked with Laravel and the Vue ecosystem such as Nuxt and Vuetify. Recently I have been getting more into React as well. I helped build munichNFT 1 which is a platform for local artists to easily mint their artwork and display it.

On the Swapr frontend, I've in particular:\n\n- Developed the whole SWPR conversion flow solution after the first DXvote deployment on Arbitrum One got lost, together with the ownership of the first set of Swapr contract. This included writing a simple conversion smart contract, and developing a frontend solution to use it. The frontend checks for various things once the user connects their wallet. In particular, since the ols SWPR claimer was kept, if the user still had to claim their old SWPR, they'd be asked to do so as the first step. If no claim is left to perform, and the user still has old SWPR balance in any amount, they're asked to simply convert it through 2 transactions. The first one approves the old SWPR to be handled by the conversion contract, and the second one effectively converts old SWPR to new SWPR. An additional check consisted in detecting people that had provided liquidity to the old SWPR token in the old SWPR contracts. If that condition is detected, the LP is asked to immediately pull all lqiuidity from the old build before getting any further in the conversion process.\n- Fixed flicker on claim airdrop or convert SWPR sign at the top right of the page.\n- Fixed a casing issue that made it impossible for some airdrop recipients to claim their part in the overall drop.\n- Made it so that the farming campaign page auto-updates once the countdown for the current period reaches zero. The campaign will be shown as active once the \"upcoming\" countdown reaches the end, and it will be shown as expired once the \"active\" countdown comes to an end.\n- Move stuff previously settable only through env to the SDK, to clean up both the code and build process. This stuff mainly includes platform's addresses on Arbitrum One and IPFS cid of the airdrop whitelist.\n- Completely removed any trace of the disclaimer bar that was used to tell users accessing Swapr builds not containing `swapr.eth` in the URL that the build was not the official one.\n- Prepared the beta 4.1 release on Github, containing minor UX improvements such as Arbiscan links on Arbitrum One and the update on the previous point.\n- Prepared the beta 5 release on Github, containing the whole old SWPR conversion flow described in the first point.\n- Shown unwrapped native currency everywhere in the frontend. That is, when a pair contains a native currency wrapper token such as WETH or WXDAI, abstract that away from the end user. The main advantage is on the add liquidity page and swap box. When adding liquidity to a pair containing the native currency wrapper, for example, the user is not required anymore to have the wrapped token in their wallet. The UI and router contract will take care of the wrapping on-chain automatically if the user wants to provide the raw native currency.\n- Avoided UI overflow when liquidity deposits return a very small amount of liquidity tokens to the LP (not related to the provisioned liquidity value, just to the quantity of the LP tokens returned).\n- Helped implement the token tooltip on the farming campaign page. Previously only a small icon was shown right after the token amount, making it hard to read the overall info.\n- Added Sushiswap ecorouting option in Arbitrum One.\n- Helped adding links to DXstats back to the pair page.\n- Fixed the APY badge alignment in the pair cards.\n- Fixed the mobile layout of the pair/farming cards list.\n- Removed the explainer at the bottom of the all pairs page.\n- Prepared the beta 6 release on Github.\n\nOn DXstats, I have:\n\n- Implemented a mobile menu to make it possible to browse the various page and analytics offered by the platform.\n- Fixed a pagination issues that blocked items in the pairs and tokens list to be shown.\n- Added comprehensive metadata and a link thumbnail to improve the link-sharing experience.\n- Fixed token icons not showing up sometimes, and also a race condition issue that plagued some `useEffect` hooks in the codebase.\n- Upgrade the subgraph to be queried to get the correct data on Arbitrum One.\n- Included staked liquidity when calculating the overall liquidity provided by a user on Swapr.\n- Implemented dynamic swap fee fetching for each shown pairs. Swapr has swap fees changeable through governance, and they're now precisely shown on each pair in DXstats, and also correctly used to calculate overall earned fees etc etc.\n- Increased support for token icons on Arbitrum One.\n- Fixed the top LPs per pair list to include staked liquidity too.\n\nOn the token and airdrop whitelist front, I have:\n\n- Fixed the whitelist generation script to include some DXD that wasn't previously taken into account. Most of the whitelisted accounts weren't affected by the issue, but since the DXD holders' airdrop was weighted by held balance, it turned out most got ~7% more SWPR than they should have. To correct it and make it equal across the board, everyone was made to get ~7% more SWPR in the unlocked drop. Since this issue only included DXD holders, the SWPR amount necessary to make this fix a reality was taken from the locked part of the airdrop. In order to fully fix this, a second distribution of SWPR on Arbitrum One will need to be done to make the airdrop recipient whole.\n\nOn Carrot, I've mainly polished the whole platform and increased talks with potential first users that would like to use the platform to incentivize their communities.\n\nProof for the claims above can be verified by looking at my commits on the various platforms's repos. In particular:\n\n- For Swapr frontend, check out [this](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/commits/develop?author=luzzif).\n- For DXstats, check out [this](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-info/commits/develop?author=luzzif).\n- For the SWPR token and airdrop whitelist fix, check out [this](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-token-contracts/commits/master?author=luzzif).\n- For Carrot, the codebase is not yet public at the time of writing, but most likely will be in the near future. As I said, most of the work was done to the frontend, so check that out once it goes public.","title":"DAI payout (26/08/2021-26/09/2021) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmPTXtBYDALmBfZGGKmQSsXDHdCy1n4KaE1vL8ubNEn8QC"},"0x7dd1a6275b358c040e113a069c88d3f44e4782ba1138cb8c30be2670e26d4b8a":{"description":"This is a proposal to receive the outstanding DXD that has vested to me since I started work with DXdao in Decemver 2020.

This included pulling all REP holder addresses and addresses of wallets that participated in the DXD bonding curve, screening them with blockchain investigations software, breaking down the results by risk score, and manually investigating wallet addresses the software scored as risky.\n\n(-) Struggled to generate useful analysis on LPs to Omen. When I began, I was unable to query several relevant contracts in Dune Analytics (was receiving a permission denied error that no one was able to decipher). About a month and a half later I was able to query the contracts, but struggled to associate the addresses emitted by the contracts with the party ultimately responsible for effectuating the transactions. I asked for help from several Omen squad members: @KadenZipfel provided some help, but I struggled to implement some of his suggestions. I also reached out to @0xVenky but I missed the first call we had scheduled, and he has been very busy with other Omen related tasks since.\n\nLessons learned:\n\n15 hours a week is unrealistic : While I have worked 15 hours a week some weeks, specifically during the blockchain investigation, most weeks I have worked closer to 6-7 hours a week (because I was blocked technically or waiting for folks to get back to me with guidance/feedback). I spent a lot of that time debugging errors in Dune Analytics and The Graph. So, my next worker proposal will be for fewer hours a week. \n\nBringing on support for technical tasks: The Omen team is very busy and I don’t think it’s realistic to receive hand-holding on analytics tasks. To that end I have identified a data engineer and a machine learning engineer who are interested in Web3 governance and prediction markets respectively. I will work with the machine learning engineer to generate those metrics. I will also work with the data engineer to develop metrics on REP holder engagement for a project @Tammy is working on. By offloading some of this technical work to interested parties I will be freed up to focus on where I can add the most value; working on compliance and legal issues with @Tammy. 3 days after providing the ML engineer with some background on the Omen FPMMs, he was able to mostly complete the analysis.\n\nTl;dr; I enjoy working with DXdao but I need to refocus on tasks that are suited for my skill-set. I have a plan to do that, and with the community’s support, will put it into motion.\n\nCompensation\n\n2,100 USDC = 4,856 (total) - 2,756 (paid in WP 1))\n2,343 DXD = 4687(total) / 2\n.1333 REP (1542 REP)\nExperience Level: 4\n\nOriginal worker proposal: https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-jordan-amphiboly-05-15-to-08-01/2931 ","title":"Amphiboly Worker Proposal | 2021-05-15 / 2021-08-01","hash":"QmXrXiitP1iDuPEJWQKBfamC96EapXFKV51Z1NyemeWZM1"},"0x7f73a8c7943c415900d93e117739eeba8c1b4a187f5f936d02cfb42e6fe66fa8":{"description":"I havent been claiming my REP for a long time, I talked with @allyq if she can help me figure out how much do I have to ask in mainnet and gnosis chain by seeing she help Federico in his REP sync https://daotalk.org/t/mainnet-rep-sync-luzzifoss/4453.\n\nHere is a link to the spreadsheet showing the calculations: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uDQkFzGNkdrEHgMUxdMvviSXFjeph_gxCu3uB6982aw/edit#gid=0\n\n|REP AFTER 2/21:||Requested on gnosis?|\n|---|---|---|\n|3/21|1278|Yes|\n|4/21|2545|Yes|\n|5/21|^|Yes|\n|6/21|no proposal |-|\n|7/21|2545|Yes|\n|8/21|^|Yes|\n|9/21|2766.8533|No|\n|10/21|2766.8533|No|\n|11/21|1840.5151|No|\n|12/21|1840.5151|No|\n|1/22|1840.5151|No|\n|2/22|not requesting|-|\n|3/22|1928.9549|no|\n|4/22|1928.9549|no|\n|5/22|1928.9549|no|\n|6/22|2011.8974|no|\n|7/22|2011.8974|no|\n|8/22|2011.8974|no|\n|Total yet to be requested on chain: 22,877.8088|||\n|Total to sync to mainnet: 29,245.8088|||\n\nThis proposal request 22,877 REP in gnosis chain.","title":"AugustoL REP Mint sync to 8/22","hash":"QmT9ncDgSPErh97Ara8rTxwXa96tLZdA5eNPkNaJA9hbWj"},"0x7fb7e060c4b6442e2cbd4fbd48bde7005c8553c9fa10f27d8d266793593fab6b":{"description":"I am submitting a proposal with a Contribution Recap for the 3/22 to 4/22 period and a request for second payment.

The group discussed lots of ideas - the problems DAOs face today, why and it matters, how the underlying infrastructure also needs to be decentralized.\n\n- Invited to join and participate in a DAO-focused panel alongside a Yearn contributor hosted by Shannon, head community at LivePeer, at the LivePeer Community Summit. The LivePeer community is moving towards DAOifying and was interested to hear about the learnings and practices of DXdao and Yearn.\n\n- Represented DXdao at Gitcoin’s Schelling Point Amsterdam. I was happy to follow Aya Miyaguchi from the Ethereum Foundation and [present on how DAOs can use results-based incentive tokens](https://youtu.be/WneLqBdpFlA). The crowd seemed into the newer concept and a few people asked interesting follow up questions.\n\n- Helping to drive the initiative to integrate COW protocol into Swapr and helping to line up the leveraging of Swapr for the COW token drop and liquidity mining program. Led to the most noteworthy use of Swapr farming since the launch of Swapr.\n\n**Self Evaluation:** The following is a self-evaluation on what I’ve done well, okay, and not well.\n\n* **Did Well:** One of the most valuable things I can do for DXdao is to continue to represent the collective across various communities, high profile events, and public forums to grow awareness of DXdao and connect DXdao to important entities in the space. This is leading to more awareness of DXdao and its products. I think this overall also helps attract new contributors to DXdao.\n* **Did OK:** I think my initiative to take on the role as “main coordinator” of the Carrot Awareness Campaign was important, and allowed it to come to fruition. There were some problems around tight timing, producing assets and implementation, that could have been coordinated better on my part. Next time, we need to start things with more lead time.\n* **Needs Improvement:** Again, I think clearly defining and communicating the actions that other communities can take with regards to DXdao products is still an unanswered task that we have struggled with from a DXbiz perspective.\n\nAs outlined in my kickoff proposal, my commitment percentage for March is 90% so I am adjusting accordingly.\n\n**Proposal Summary:**\n\nSummary of compensation would be:\n\n* 8,100 USD to be paid in xDai (9,000 xDAI x 90% = 8,100)\n* Approval for: 16,150 USD (Mar’22 -> 9,500 x 80% = 7,600 and Apr’22 -> 9,500 x 90% = 8,550) to be paid in DXD in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff when the work agreement finishes. The vesting contract would be created and funded in the future after 4/30/2022 and use 03/01/2022 as the starting date of the vesting.\n* Zero REP will be claimed on this contributor proposal (in order to not go over 4% mainnet REP)\n\n**Payout Request in this Proposal:**\n8,100 xDAI","title":"SkyMine Labs - 3/22 to 4/22 Contribution Recap & Payment","hash":"QmeUfAZAbnqjxCzkXSM9fBFMqovQmZv2E9KqqFYUkY577i"},"0x7fdfb17e86f1d69c15d43ca8f1a4ceaa1273528f4673f9404cca61f59de8524c":{"description":"I fernund#1218 am requesting REP in relation to my DXdao Discord participation level.

During that time, I automated several tasks using Python and PowerQuery, and wrote documentation, standardized and implemented the Kanban methodology on various business processes.\n\nIn 2021, I decided to switch careers and focus on learning the JavaScript stack during off-work hours and weekends, finally going full-time on learning in December and starting a bootcamp in January 2022.\n\nMy whole life I’ve been tech-oriented. I wrote my first line of code when I was 13 and had been programming on and off since then. When Bitcoin was starting, I remember trying to set up a mining node on an old HP laptop (I don’t know if I succeeded, but who knows, maybe there’s a laptop somewhere worth a couple of bitcoins).\n\nI’m interested in blockchain development to translate current governance processes into a robust decentralized system. My vision for the future is a world where small organizations can easily set up fully decentralized and transparent processes that are also scalable and secure.\n\nI’m currently contributing to the DXvote project on the front-end but want to learn and gather a more profound knowledge of smart contracts and solidity development.\n\nThis is my first contributor proposal and was introduced to DXdao by Augusto.

By doing so I’ve developed a better understanding of the repo which allows me to work a bit faster than when I started.

I’ve learned it’s more time efficient in the long run to write bug-free, cleaner code, taking time not only to write something of higher quality but also the time to read docs of what is not understood.

I will continue to work in these areas but also place more focus on structuring compliance roadmaps for DXdao for AML questions with our on-chain treasury.\n\nProposed Responsibilities and Goals:\n\nOMN Guild project management assistance in documentation for launch, manage the creation of an Omen video for the landing page with Ilio, continued work on token distribution, and seek out partnerships.\n\nWork with @amphiboly to retain a firm to complete a blockchain analysis of DXdao’s treasury to establish best practices for an AML compliance program. Research, develop, and implement a compliance program that would address areas of potential exposure to KYC/AML/sanctions risks. Create a program to establish requirements around tools and data DXdao can use to screen funds and counter-parties.\n\nContinued contributor assistance with company formation questions.\nCoordination with law firm Polsinelli, PC to answer DXdao’s general legal questions.\n\nDXventures coordination.

I’m also happy that we (@powers) successfully completed the buyback transparency documentation.\n\nDid Okay: I’ve reached out to all contributors regarding company formation, and have set up various meetings with outside counsel. However, this is still an ‘in-progress’ project that I’d like to fully complete in the first portion of this contract period. I need to follow-up more completely with outside counsel to reach a conclusion on these issues, and I’d like to make real progress on this in the coming weeks. Separately, with our new projects, like DXventures, I’m still working on how to best communicate with the community to come to a consensus on providing grants to projects.\n\nNeeds Improvement: I’m late on this proposal along with other budget request proposals.

During my next worker proposal I plan on spending more time looking at yielding opportunities and deploying some initial amount of funds into yielding protocols (stables and/or ETH).\n\nOver the past months I’ve also been working closely with @powers and am coordinating with him on helping / assisting with any governance items closely related to the treasury. As @powers will be taking some time off over the next months, I will also start being more involved in governance overall including driving the Wednesday governance call. I will also start taking over expenses and budgeting from @powers.\n\nI’m also assisting @tammy on exploring some potential legal entities which could facilitate operations as well as help with contributor liabilities / tax obligations. While still in a very initial stage, we are exploring options which can make it easier for anyone around the world to work for DXdao - without compromising on on-chain governance and decentralization. \n\n**Self-Reflection:**\n\nOverall, I believe my technical knowledge still has room for improvement. I’ve started working with web3py over these past two months, attempting to interact more directly with our products, rather than relying on APIs such as Etherscan / Coingecko. But still struggling somewhat, particularly when working with L2s.\n\nWhen it comes to treasury diversification, we saw some high ETH prices over the past two months. While we were able to sell at a high ETH price, it would be nice if we could move even faster in the future. I plan to explore some options so we can move faster in the future. Currently, if timed perfectly, we can get a proposal to pass on mainnet in 8 days.

I’ve been able to eliminate other commitments outside of DXdao, allowing me to spend my time exclusively on DXdao. I believe there is enough work to keep me occupied, particularly with me taking on more responsibilities, and I am very much looking forward to being part of more initiatives at DXdao.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis proposal falls under the current Contributor Guidelines, enacted on February 17, 2021. Should DXdao approve any changes to the Contributor Guidelines Compensation Structure that go into effect during my stated contract period, I reserve the right to introduce an updated DAOtalk post and on-chain proposal to adjust the above stated compensation amounts to reflect the new compensation structure.","title":"fluiddrop Worker Proposal 18th July - 18th September [1st Payment]","hash":"QmRQyMfQx6iWwVHcvDCxcUYt9y2N2XhJTJCeHSAGrbT2HY"},"0x81fbc32f9e393747de0768d5d36a4b13690280283b7d10f11757a6e46be15bb1":{"description":"Gem1no Worker Proposal – Front-End Developer Level 1\n\nBackground:\n\nSince 02/23/21, I’ve been working with the Omen team as a front-end developer.

I’m very grateful to all of you, for being so supportive no matter what. DXdao is genuinely one of the most inspiring and motivating communities to work in. Traditional companies can't hold a candle to a true DAO!\n\nThe DXgov squad continued to focus on Project DAVI during the past few months. We have done large improvements to our codebase and processes and also sent the smart contracts for auditing. A retrospective on the past proposal period can be found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/madusha-contributor-proposal-01-05-2022-30-06-2022/4206/2), which goes into more detail.\n\nIn the current proposal period, the focus will continue to remain on DAVI. We have an upcoming re-audit of the smart contracts and plan to start working on the next milestones in the DXgov roadmap.\n\n### Proposed Scope of Contribution\n\n**1. Goals:**\n\n  * Continue supporting DAVI development and refactoring efforts.\n  * Investigate and fix any bugs encountered during QA testing.\n  * Help implement the social layer of DAVI, powered by Orbis.\n  * Fix any remaining smart contract issues and possibly start working on the next release of DXdao contracts.\n  * Help improve the developer experience and overall code quality.\n\n**2. Responsibilities:**\n\n  * Collaborate with DXgov members to build and improve our governance products.\n  * Keep DXvote development efforts on-track, according to the Attack Plan.\n  * Actively engage in improving the developer experience and ways of working.\n\n### Time commitment\n\n* 80% availability.\n* I will be moving to Europe within this proposal period.

The order requires 10 WETH in the Swapr xDXD/WETH pool when the oracle checks and has a minimum amount of DXD accepted of 25 DXD.

Was very happy to meet everyone for the first time in Colombia. Participating in a hackathon, Ethereum conference and DXretreat felt amazing, huge thanks to organisers. Here are some of the projects from the past period that I would like to highlight:\n\n- Carrot\n\nTogether with @international.blue tand @luzzifoss we’ve been steadily progressing on a new UI for Carrot Dapp. Visually it will be completely different from the one that we have now. Some of the UX tasks and flows feel pretty complicated and I’m very curious to see how they will turn out.\n\n-  DAVI\n\nStarted contributing to the project DAVI. My main tasks that was discussed with @ross are: 1) a better mobile experience; 2) a very slight UI branding redesign that will not slow down the development.\nEven though I am just getting started, I’m sure that I can be a useful addition for DAVI at the current stage, so I have a good feeling about this.\n\n - Infinite Hackathon\n\nParticipated in my first hackathon, joined @dinocres and @Milton to hack on a project based on DAVI. The Infinite Hackathon felt very cozy, I learned a lot and enjoyed it very much. Our project goals were to enable cross-guild voting (voting on multiple proposals with just one on-chain transaction) and off-chain voting (vote without gas fees and let other voters execute your vote). At a first glance those ideas felt very complex, but I was amazed how, thanks to our teamwork, we found solutions to build it in a very short period of time.

The scope of Beta 12 gradually increased from a major release to a mega release. (New swapbox, ecoBridging, Socket Integration, Polygon support for ecoRouter)\n- Coordinating with Paolo and Wixzi on the DxStats release. This has been pending for almost half a year and we are working on the stats to fix some critical issues.\n- Working with Zett and Ross on the guilds and a plan on what functions would be first used by the guilds.\n- Onboarding MilanV, Paolo, Wixzi, Diogo and Jorge.\n- Met a bunch of dxers in Amsterdam and it was great to meet them personally after working with them for almost 6 to 8 months, some over a year.\n\n**Tasks and areas that could be better:**\nSwapr should probably do better in terms of release planning and make shorter releases. There are lot of features that are being built in parallel, we get to a stage where we are done 85 to 90%, but it kind of takes a longer time where it is release ready.\n\n**Compensation**:\n\nAs part of the compensation, I would like to receive 8000 XDAI as form of payment. Some of these services are being administered through Caney Fork LLC and so this is a payout proposal to CaneyFork.eth.

I think we doubled down on the idea of an open organization, the real idea of decentralization, and became exceptionally good at taking criticism and improving ourselves from outside feedback.\n\nThe vision and long term outlook of DXdao is relatively clear and concise. What I do think we are missing the middle layer of social and organizational tools for strategy and efficiency. By nature of the organization being a DAO, there is no direct hierarchy and at times initiatives are pulled in different directions, which is not always bad! However, I do think we need to polish our mid term strategy, define and formalize leadership pockets, and set goals and objectives for the mid term. My bias leans towards yearly DXdao OK-Rs and quarterly squad OKRs (with incentives!) but I’m open for other frameworks and suggestions.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XmHrOrS.png)\n\n","title":"GreaterThan Workshop in DXretreat","hash":"QmYU7yK43QffdRKu1dorcubV5MBc8FQiR33yguer4dxy2G"},"0x876c18569af33d71ec1942b7ac49d3d833a892fb4a798df6339a20a05fe5f791":{"description":"This proposal is a test transaction to see if we can exchange ERC20 tokens directly on curve through a generic multicall scheme.\n\nThis proposals authorizes the 3pool on curve to withdraw 10wxDai from DXdao treasury\n","title":"Test proposal to swap 10 wxDai to USDC on Curve 3Pool [Authorize 3Pool 10 wxDai]","hash":"QmSynGcaxTK4StJ1aqsoMMdinsGGj8dpfwfHy7NZb5vMiY"},"0x877975e75677e13e6c8ab8e43e8dcc5047bf692db39f7c2e1b4c1fb1cdc0779f":{"description":"\n    \nThis proposal places a 7 WETH order on CowSwap for DXD.

Currently, I am still planning on working part-time since I have my full-time job at JP Morgan still. I also have my final dissertation for my part-time university honours degree due in August which is taking up a lot of my time.\n\nFortunately, after this worker period, there is nothing stopping me from going full time with DXdao which all things going well is what I would like to do.\n\nMy trial period was very enjoyable, learning how the DAO works was super interesting after attending most daily calls. Also, I was made very welcome and comfortable working on the aqua team.\n\nMostly I worked on frontend issues and features since this is what I have the most experience with. I also shared some of my experience working on larger development teams by trying to make aqua more agile and easier for teams to work on. This involved helping Martin to set up a change flow and advising how we should be handling versioning to make the entire aqua stack more transparent for all contributors. More details around my trial period can be found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/ross-worker-proposal-1-6-21-1-7-21/3018) .\n\nSince I am used to being a full-stack developer I have tried to take a larger part of smart contract development and not just frontend. There are some blockers to this that should be alleviated with agile changes and so in future, I hope to work more on all parts of the dapp.\n\nI have also been enjoying getting to know more people from the dao and taking a larger part in governance. I’m looking forward also to meeting everyone at EthCC and becoming a larger part of this great community.\n\nWith current uncertainty with Aqua’s leadership and future in mind, I am open to working on other DXdao projects also wherever my skills may be applicable.\n\n**Timeframe:**\n2 months (first payment)\n\n**Goals:**\n- Work on polishing aqua to be in a state to securely and safely launch fixed-price sales on the platform\n- Next in the UI, I will focus on creating a smooth user experience for the fair sale auction mechanism with the rest of the team\n- Take a part in the development, initially small fixes, of smart contracts and generally increasing my understanding of the SC side of the project\n- Make development in the team smoother and more transparent experience to increase increment speed of aqua prototypes and releases\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n- Keeping the team working in an agile way with proper use of issues, pr reviews and versioning\n- In Martin’s absence I will be leading the daily aqua calls as well as representing the aqua team at DXdao calls and trying to keep development going towards MVP release\n\n**Compensation:**\nExperience level: 3\n\n**Time commitment:** Part-time - Over my trial period I had estimated 10-20 hours a week and I was closer to 20 during this period. In the next 2 months I will be busier with my full-time job and other commitments and so I don’t expect it will be quite so high. I estimate 15 hours a week on average with some weeks more. I will track this as before in a spreadsheet with the Aqua team.\n\nHopefully, this will be my last part-time worker proposal as I should be able to move to full-time at the end of this period.\n\n**Salary** - Calculated from 37.5% rate at further 80% rate due to first proposal after trial period, will recalculate depending on actual amount worked in second part of proposal:\n\n$1800 DAI ($2250 x 80%), to be sent on the first payment proposal\n2.296 DXD for first month (2.87 x 0.8) in a vesting contract continuously for two years with a one year cliff from proposal start (18/6/21)\n782 REP for first month (977.5 x 0.8)\n\nThis proposal falls under the current worker compensation guidelines. Should DXdao governance approve any changes to the compensation structure that could apply to work during this scope of work, the compensation amounts in this proposal may change and be reflected in the amounts requested in the final on-chain proposal.\n\n[Daotalk forum proposal](https://daotalk.org/t/ross-worker-proposal-18-6-2021-18-8-2021/3099)\n\nWork done on aqua can be found on my github [here](https://github.com/rossneilson) \n\nIn addition, my representation of aqua in the community call can be found on the [DXdao youtube channel](https://youtu.be/ekQMCd-ZBJo)\n\nKeybase signature:\nBEGIN KEYBASE SALTPACK SIGNED MESSAGE. kXR7VktZdyH7rvq v5weRa0zkVcD8Vb 4xE6FUqemnxBdTM Be51MWTB9H1OgJZ qSk2qzed4vB6nlu p5OWDRNmiLI7DDr Y25m4D0mO5ZT42f geC0gYsbVe3cY1a 1CxFy59NBf3grcS 4pv5ERQHdtZJPrs LSpjXhTImyjuTFM Jfr4QVPE5Ga3wAF PWbKj0LmBkITxkg asPmakMNgva6j78 VtagwO2xzIKuuGc 52sGhgcwlMkGmCP 8uzOs26eAx1H6D8 9Nj6UG.

I made a lot of mistakes and learned a lot of things, but ultimately I believe that DXdao, DXgov and DAVI have come out of it all a lot stronger. We all still have a long way to go but I hope the worst is behind us and we can really make an improvement to how DXdao operates and its success.\n\nAfter the retreat, I feel closer to everyone and more aligned than ever.\n\nLet's enable community freedom!\n\n**Goals:**\n\n* Release DAVI in public beta\n* Launch a DXgov guild with a 6 month budget and OKRs (Dependent upon phase 2 passing in its current state)\n* Dogfood DAVI internally as much as possible\n  * Rep guilds for internal operations\n  * DXD and SWPR ERC20 guilds\n* Have the first external guilds ready to launch\n* Deploy DXdao 1.5 contracts and begin to support them in DAVI once audit is back\n* Bring fully onboard DXvoice and BizDev to help DAVI achieve success\n* Further the discussion started about DXdao’s vision and enable DAVI to be the central piece to what we are all building\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n* Communicate and ensure DAVI’s development is transparent and clear to all\n* Balancing project lead responsibilities with development work (trying to reduce development while still adding value)\n* Leading DXgov calls and representing the project in DXdao calls\n* Coordinating between different teams in DXdao for guilds and feature requests, etc\n* Ensuring the team contributors are all happy, enjoying their work and reaching their potential\n* Providing a transparent look into what the DXgov team is working on and achieving\n* Managing project and sprints to ensure the team is moving forward in the most efficient and prioritised way to deliver our goals\n* Long-term planning about what DXgov will be and build\n* Taking an overall large part in the direction of DXdao\n\n**Reflection on last worker period:**\n\n**Did well:**\n\n* **Releasing DAVI** - If I have one takeaway or phrase from this period it would be “Perfection is the enemy of good”, it became clear that we need to get DAVI out there and now that we have the audit back there was nothing stopping us other than striving for perfection.\n  * **Private beta** - I demoed the application to DXdao on a call and put out a test environment for feedback of which we got lots! From this we did more releases publicly testing out update formats.\n  * **Public beta** - The public beta was defined as going onto production networks which went less well. We managed to get DAVI into a production state just for devcon but unfortunately did not have the time to deploy and set up all the guilds we wanted to show off. However, this should be complete before the end of October and hopefully better communication than we could have managed during the chaos of devcon.\n\nAn extra thanks to Kenny and the entire team for helping to refine our release process, excited for where this will go!\n\n* **Contracts off to audit** - Coordinating with omega to get 1.5 contracts off to audit is a big step to having DXdao move to DAVI and then supporting gov 2.0. Great work here by Augusto and the entire team for getting involved with smart contract development. https://daotalk.org/t/dxgov-governance-1-5-contracts-audit/4553\n* **Public speaking** - Aside from my panel in Denver and an online panel shortly after I have not done any public speaking so I was pretty nervous leading up to the daoist in Bogota. I put a lot of time into the talk “Overlooked: Accessible Autonomy” on my flight over and thanks to Boris I got some awesome slides prepared. The talk went really well and I am looking forward to doing more speaking in the future. (Will post the video here once it is available)\n* **Retreat** - This retreat whilst far from relaxing was incredibly productive and I feel I was able to communicate and add to the discussions in a very meaningful way. I cant wait to see these discussions turn into actions and I am super grateful to everyone I had great conversations with. It was my honour to be a part of formalising the vision of DXdao: “Enable community freedom”\n* **Testing new processes** - As we approach production there is a lot we can improve about how we work and manage products. One of the first steps is testing out canny which seems to work well as a place to track roadmap features and get feedback from users: https://davi.canny.io/\n\n**Did ok:**\n\n* **Partnerships** - Over Devcon we further increased partnerships although have not followed through on any yet, mostly due to the still early stage of the product. Orbis is an example of this going well as we met up in Devcon to plan our partnership and further integration in DAVI. Having the biz dev team meet with them was also great and I hope more like this can happen as we have more to show.\n* **DAVI architecture** - I spent a good amount of time discussing with the team how we are tackling support for 1.5 in DAVI settling on a subgraph with contract reads as a backup. I also had great architecture talks with Orbis about how we can effectively merge social aspects with governance. I do however want to solidify these architectures more in writing.\n* **2.0 planning** - There was less time in the retreat than I thought there would be for technical discussion in squads but we did find time to run through plans for the voting machine architecture and discussed many tough problems and came up with some solutions. Still more to do here.\n* **DAVI branding** - Working with Dirk on branding for the DAVI landing page has been awesome and I am so glad we have such amazing talent in DXdao. I put it in ok simply because there was not enough time to properly coordinate with DXvoice on marketing or publication efforts using some of this new branding.\n\n**Could have done better:**\n\n* **Coordination between squads** - Just a general reflection that is a larger problem recently identified and voiced in DXdao but part of that also falls on me. With the restructuring and everything done at the retreat, we are moving towards a way of working that more naturally encourages this so I am hopeful we can all do better here.\n* **IPFS solutions** - Ideally I was wanting to further this initiative of DAO infrastructure to decentralise our storage solutions but I really just didn’t find the time. I had thought about hacking a dappnode project on infinite hackathons but had no time with mentoring plus preparing my talk. But the idea is still super awesome, I’m hopeful I can find some time for it soon.\n* **Distractions** - A lot went on in the DAO over this period and I think it took up way too much of my bandwidth for a while. Caring about the direction of the DAO while continuing daily tasks can be tough.\n\n**Timeframe**: 2 months\n\n**Compensation**: Level 6\n\n**Salary** -\n\nI will be receiving my funds via devx the new service provider we have partnered with and as such proposals will transfer stablecoins to an address other than my own.\n\n**1st month -**\n\n$8000 DAI\n\n$6000 DXD\n\n0.1667% REP\n\n**2nd month:**\n\n$8000 DAI\n\n$6000 DXD\n\n0.1667% REP","title":" Ross Neilson Worker Proposal 18/10/2022-18/12/2022 1/2","hash":"QmWMGv3VkNMW23dw1RjN2acdJu1Q9hVaDtrWreJSzHZDnD"},"0x8c3e25430e894d11d4da49d86f1c3df389c3cf3bb16c36baade99a4b0fe488eb":{"description":"_Tldr, this proposal would update the parameters of the DXD Buyback program and extend by $500k. There are new parameters that change the definition of NAV that govern purchases. This was discussed on [DAOTalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/authorize-500k-of-dxd-buybacks-with-new-parameters-proposal/4434). This is a mirror proposal of [the mainnet one](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/mainnet/proposal/0x072519e7fa7d55619fcc675c5c47e446e499ee454da1f2b370825ac447d06758)_\n\n## Background\n\nThe DXD token was launched through a [novel bonding curve contract](https://dxtrust.eth.limo/#/), where DXD could be minted or burned in exchange for ETH in the buyback reserve. The bonding curve [was later paused](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/mainnet/proposal/0x97c7d7e5ed9f74f62ef5d15a6dffac8a62a4d52b883491a7e8b13cf7816991ad) and the DXD Buyback Program was launched in May 2021. The initial 3,659 DXD was purchased by DXdao’s general treasury, while almost 11,000 DXD was purchased [using funds from the buyback reserve](https://daotalk.org/t/proposed-dxd-token-model/2898).\n\nLooking ahead, the community is moving to [a new DXD token model](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-token-working-group/4388/10), but while these discussions are ongoing, DXdao governance is considering[ more medium term](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-update-and-next-steps-july-2022/4374) solutions to drive value to DXD. and discussing what to do once the buyback reserve is depleted after DXD Buyback Extension #9 extended it for the last 107 ETH. [DXD Buyback Extension #8](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/mainnet/proposal/0x69a881265303706f921c9c1ad25de4b0635ff288893455b34f18cdaf9e7f86de) passed on mainnet & said:\n\n> If and when the DXD Buyback Program depletes the buyback reserve, funds from the DXdao treasury can be used to purchase DXD on the open market at up to 70% of NAV, so long as this calculation accounts for runway and future funding for product development.\n\n## Details\n\nThis proposal authorizes up to $500,000 of DXD to be purchased from the general treasury as long as the DXD NAV Ratio, which is the DXD Circulating Market Cap divided by DXdao Treasury NAV, is under 70%. \n\nOrders may be no more than 25% of DXD average daily trading volume and can only occur three times over seven days. Buyback order submissions can be above the 25% ADTV amount in the event that the previous week saw buyback orders with a combined purchase size less than 75% of the DXD ADTV.\n\nDXD Circulating Market Cap is calculated by taking the price of DXD on Swapr mainnet and multiplying it by the total amount of DXD that is outside of DXdao’s treasury (mainnet, Gnosis Chain and Arbitrum one), DXdao’s DXD vesting contract and any other DXdao-owned contracts on Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Arbitrum or any chain with a DXdao-sanctioned base. DXD issued for contributor compensation will contribute to the DXD Circulating Market Cap calculation when the DXD vests.\n\nTreasury NAV is the assets of DXdao minus its liabilities. DXdao’s assets are made up of Core Assets and Auxiliary Assets. Core Assets consists of all ETH, staked ETH, stablecoins and Swapr LP deposits owned by DXdao on Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Arbitrum or any chain with a DXdao-sanctioned base. Core Assets contribution to Treasury NAV is 100% of its current USD value. Auxiliary assets are all non-core assets in DXdao (excluding DXD & GEN). Auxiliary Assets have an adjustable Treasury NAV Contribution Percentage. Auxiliary Assets’ contribution to Treasury NAV is its current USD value multiplied by its Treasury NAV Contribution Percentage. As part of this proposal, all Auxiliary Assets are assigned a 25% Treasury NAV Contribution Percentage.\n\nFor Treasury NAV calculation, DXdao’s liabilities are defined as three years of DXdao’s USD monthly runway, currently estimated at $290k a month, or $8.7m.\n\nFor clarity, below is the current DXD NAV Ratio calculation.\n\n\n\n* Circulating market cap ($15.6m) - Current price on Swapr mainnet ($430) multiplied by DXD Circulating Supply. Total DXD supply (148,976) minus [DXD controlled by DXdao](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing) (112,872) is 36,104 DXD, so DXD circulating market cap is $15.6m.\n* Treasury NAV ($28m) - Core Assets ($36m) plus, 25% of $$ value of Auxiliary Assets ($722k), minus $8.7m. [See breakdown here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16qohANt7KjYmknIvgHkWtWcma2_QQU12ik6fvqxk0cc/edit?usp=sharing)\n* Current DXD NAV Ratio: 55.6%\n\n## Risks and Considerations\n\nBuybacks are typically carried out on Gnosis Chain, which is a sidechain with a lower security model. The [same risk factors](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUxvBCgv6nCq2BdKJTKsSbX7hQ6jAixqCBrpgW1QiZ8Lv) that were laid out in the original DXD Buyback Proposal apply here. There is no guarantee that buyback purchase will sustain the price of DXD and it does decrease the value of the treasury.","title":" Authorize $500k of DXD buybacks with new parameters","hash":"QmPcfsm7gYx1TRtAHrB27UVNiihEUqtPk6eSQvmTFqKqx2"},"0x8c42f88414f620b69859fcd72710b51091a9bb3c9e246c88a78e910350108431":{"description":"Period review\n\n\nThe good: \n\nFor these two months trial period the main goal was to be technical onboarded in general on Guilds and to be able to create FTC, HappyPath flow as a starting point and test PRs.

This proposal places an order for 7.37 WETH using a [$1305.88 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was originally passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45), and extended for another $1m to $3m total, through a further proposal which also passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x56c66f99d87a48d707475aa2466f0a58da13bd744475410957d6572b439cc5bf). The extension on the buyback program was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/extend-dxd-buyback-program-for-another-1m-draft-proposal/3319). \n\nThis proposal would place a limit order on the Gnosis Protocol at a price that is 3% above the time-weighted average price of xDXD/WETH on Swapr when the proposal is executed and the [Oracle contract is called](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xFbAc9467FCcb14394860A9E280E2FBabCBbc8DD2/transactions).

This guarantees settlement of the KPI token even if one of the collateral tokens used is faulty/malicious. This protects both the user and the KPI token creator, as the former has guaranteed settlement and the latter has the ability to always collect reimboursements by collateral token, potentially avoiding recovering faulty collateral tokens and limiting damage.\n- Implemented more and more tests.\n- Optimized gas consumption by adding unchecked blocks where possible.\n- Added both Github actions and pre-commit hooks to have some sort of CI in the repo. Github actions perform testing on contracts at each push, while pre-commit actions perform linting, local tests and commit message linting.\n- Added event emission across contracts to improve developer experience, discoverability and subgraph integration.\n- Optimized gas by fetching templates info on-demand from the KPI/Oracles manager contract instead of passing it in while constructing an instance of a KPI token/oracle, resulting in pretty substantial reduction in gas consumption.\n- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with useful info for anyone who wants to contribute to the contracts.\n- Fully removed Hardhat and moved Hardhat tasks to Foundry scripts (coverage tracking too).\n- Uniformed the import style across contracts (specific contract imports).\n\nProof [here](https://github.com/carrot-kpi/contracts-v1/commits/352ed9be4640d301d1cc9d18132f2bb20bff4a16).\n\nOn the alpha frontend I have:\n\n- Added 2 new featured campaigns incentivizing Swapr TVL on Gnosis chain, one rewarding SWPR and the other rewarding GNO.\n- Prepared the alpha 13 release.\n\nProof [here](https://github.com/carrot-kpi/frontend/commits/4a696cf6cad21344dac7a6156e1b09f6a338b271).\n\n### Nimi\n\nOn the frontend, I have updated the logo (proof [here](https://github.com/nimi-app/app/pull/48)) and implemented the \"import Lens profile\" button (proof [here](https://github.com/nimi-app/app/pull/49)).\n\n### Swapr\n\nOn Swapr I have [reviewed](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-sdk/pull/91) the PR to compute Uniswap v2 common pairs from the Swapr subgraph.","title":" DAI payout (26/05/2022-25/06/2022) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmbE68GbmUjsYWLV1ZFQAsevNg1uU3CG9uYeeGLztTYUSs"},"0x8d3be3183ed0bbff8b542f0852219f6559046a98d84637311c2dd68c071b3311":{"description":"This proposal calls the `ERC20withdraw` function on the Swapr Liquidity Relayer to return 26 WETH to xDXdao.\n\nThis WETH is leftover from previous Swapr Liquidity Provisioning Proposals as outlined in these mainnet proposals:\nhttps://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x26605ac44027de3d2e03f3168040ce45ed9706970fef0fec2ad8db0e870bdbba \nhttps://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xd4d5e354fe501dbcce2b8b324c8f392490c7a3f086b4c0952356c1895d09d7fa \n\nhttps://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xa2fa2560f9a595140d2100fb85d8eb5421a8fd527bc4a55ea48799ab2bd1fdb6 \n\nUsing the Swapr Liquidity Relayer requires two proposals and an oracle check to ensure tokens are deposited at the correct ratio.

Most of my time worked on systems that contain one of the blockchain components, the Crypto projects that I work on are Filecoin (Protocol Labs), Cardano (IOHK), and SLE.\nI am very passionate about Web 3.0 and Decentralized systems, because IMO the real world that has only Blockchain (where we speak about immutability and transparency) is not full-scaled without DeX, DeFi and other awesome technologies that are decentralized. I started as a QA Engineer in the DXgov Guilds team in the middle of May. Since then I started with the Onboarding process on the dapp. I attended DXdao BizDev and Dev calls, and I got some ideas for improvement. I have brainstormed with Ross and the QA Squad where we agreed how we’ll start with the QA process on the dapp. I am still working full time at my day job which I am currently unable to leave.

It concludes that 1) general partnership risks are less of a concern for DXdao compared to other US DAOs due to its lack of critical mass in one single US state and the risks can be further mitigated by DXdao’s global decentralization strategy and governance agreement regarding dispute settlements; 2) the risk of token offerings being viewed as security is low as the tokens are most likely to be viewed as utility tokens; 3) DXdao will be further exposed to US taxation risks once its product/services become more profitable given its close link with the US key contributors.\n\nIn view of the type and magnitude of risks at hand, it proposes two sets of actionable recommendations depending on the resources and priorities of DXdao:\n\nMinimal steps:\nDXlegal shall implement continuous risk monitoring and assessment with contributor squad & governance and treasury, especially in the following areas:\nContributor residence\nproduct/business map: identify which products/squads are most at US legal/taxation risks\nTreasury: pay particular attention to activities that can be tied to the US.\nLong-term talent strategy and governance:\ni.

Under the static/current law approach, it requires a multi-pronged approach that combines decentralized jurisdictions with decentralized entities/ purpose/products. Under the progressive approach, where law is a viewed as a construct and evolves to adapt the needs of society, DAOs can be recognized under the private international law, which will be aligned with DXdao’s ultimate vision as self-sovereign.\n\n3.I’ve also presented my findings at the Business Strategy call, you can find the presentation deck here:\nhttps://www.notion.so/Presentation-on-DXdao-s-US-Legal-Challenges-and-Global-Decentralization-Strategy-bc90b5810d4546dd81656a779e1d5fac\n\nPlease don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or want to discuss further.

Firstly, I would like to highlight my work on the Swapr Ad banner. When I first started working on the Swapr Ad banner I could just make it into animated gif, but that’s not very optimal because the file size limit is 300kb only. Gif banners usually have low image quality to save on file size. Decided to go with html5 animation for better quality, so I learned how to create animation in html5 and was very happy with the results. Next, when the holiday season started, it was a good opportunity to propose a little initiative - festive social media profile pictures for DXdao, Swapr and Carrot. Really glad that the idea was warmly received, more so it even followed by turning the designs into POAPs. Still wanted to add a little twist to them.

Thank you everyone.\n\n---\n\nI’ve been planning a level up as I believe the work I am doing falls under the responsibilities of level 7. However, I wanted to wait until DAVI was out there and being used by people. Although we have technically been released in beta for some time now without real use cases I still didn’t feel comfortable considering it being out. But now guilds are launched and available to all squads in DXdao to use for governance, DXgov is handling all current payments through our guild.\n\nMy last level increase came with the overall pay structure changes last year. I have been the lead of DXgov for over a year and in that time my responsibilities have changed a lot. DAVI has grown into a larger product vision for DXdao and fits in as an important part of the organisation’s vision. Responsibilities as product and squad lead are very clearly laid out in our 6 month budget 1 complete with OKRs. In addition to those management responsibilities I also continue to use my development knowledge as best I can as a hybrid role to better guide us to achieving product goals. This usually takes the form of architecture and writing tasks but also pull requests and committed code.\n\nI also hope I can continue representing the DAO more at events as I just did my first panel and then first proper talk last year. I have one more applied to already for 2023 and will continue looking for opportunities to talk about what we are doing.\n\nI included this under a contingency cost for level ups as I wanted the decision to approve my level up to be separate from the DXgov budget.\n\nThis proposal sends the additional funds for February and March ($1000*2) to the DXgov guild via the multichain MS (0x9467dcfd4519287e3878c018c02f5670465a9003).

Full-time with 40 workable days/2 months\n\n**Position:** DXvoice coordinator, Community Leader, Internal Operations and Documentation\n\n**Background:** Hey everyone! This slightly late proposal comes off the tail end of Lisbon Blockchain week. Meeting fascinating new people left and right was a very unique and humbling experience that I’ll never forget. Also; having the opportunity to meet DXdao contributors and develop more personal relationships has ignited a deeper passion, and I'm more confident than ever that we'll be able to achieve and shatter our goals. wagmi folks! *(Liscon abbreviation of the week).*\n\nDecember will also be my one year DXdao anniversary! (DXdaonniversary?) Perhaps the time to share words will be then, but I'd like to thank each and every contributor, community member, and otherwise for coming along with me for this journey. DXdao welcomed me as one of its own, and we have grown so much together. Thank you. *(I expect cake, you know. hahaha)*\n\n## Reflection on previous proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [Sept - November ](https://daotalk.org/t/keenan-luke-contributor-proposal-for-09-2021-to-11-2021/3343), what I think I did well includes:\n\n - **SWPR Emissions** - Despite a few hiccups, I believe those of us involved with SWPR emissions have done a great job at communicating, monitoring and smoothly passing relevant proposals. Since the first few frothy Epochs, the Swapr protocol has been steadily growing and integrating more projects.\n- **Discord REP Boosts** - I believe that the Discord REP Boosts have been successfully accomplishing the goal of further decentralizing governance AND involving the community with said governance. Q3 Boosts have passed and proposals have begun to pass.\n- **Community Calls** - Although I am unhappy with other facets of the community (noted below), I once again find myself thrilled over the continued growth of the DXdao community calls. They quickly became our most populated call earlier in Q3, and today stand strong with much more consistent engagement and 30-50 attendee count.\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **Community** - Although the community (Discord specifically) has been growing at a healthy pace in both member count and activity, the ratio of active participation is lower than I would like. (Percentage of accounts lurking vs interacting). Additionally, growth has diminished over the previous period (Adversely reflected by moderation/removal of dead acc./spam attack mitigation). I'd like to devote more time to retention and activity ratio as metrics, which should open the door to more natural growth.\n![image|690x325](upload://kMMLYmQxcOCQu6SRhqRAe1Pd5Xd.png)\n- **DXdocs** - No room for excuses. DXdocs was well received and is used by many of our squads (with most others looking to migrate onto it). I had a lot on my plate, but I should have prioritized DXdocs content updates and releases better. Coming into the next working period, it has become one of my top priorities.\n\n## Goals/Responsibilities:\n\n**[65%] DXvoice Coordination and Execution**\n\n* Lead DXdao’s “DXvoice” squad\n  * Organize, run, and manage various initiatives including but not limited to squad calls, marketing processes, community calls, events, content coordination, etc…\n  * Explore the potential for DXvoice to become a more independent entity with its own goals.

Although these community costs are still small, I would like to transition these to either their own proposal or the multi-sig as the costs grow - bonus benefit of deeper accountability and a trail that can be followed if I were to disappear.\n\nThe first proposal will request Month one’s xDai at the beginning of the period. The second proposal will request Month two’s xDai, and 0.3334% mainnet REP on xDai at the end of the period.

Full-time with 40 workable days/2 months\n\n**Position** : Lead of DXvoice(!) squad\n\n**Background** : Hey! I'm Keenan. I have been leading the Communications and Marketing Squad at DXdao, which we have recently renamed DXvoice! From my previous proposals, I've entered this position in a ladder fashion - beginning my engagement as communications and marketing support, and leading to a much larger commitment including orginizational tasks and guiding the operations of our marketing squad. I also lead and shipped the [DXdocs project](https://daotalk.org/t/introducing-dxdocs-v1-0-dxdao-s-native-documentation-resource/3117), am on the cusp of shipping the DXdao landing page overhaul, lead DXdao community efforts as a community leader, among some other tasks listed below.\n\nMy previous proposal ended on July 15th, the reason I left a day between these proposals is I had taken a day off for medical purposes during the previous worker proposal. To not unnecessarily complicate my proposal, I simply placed the day off before the start date of this proposal. I had a full commitment on the 16th, and no commitment on July 2nd.\n\n## Reflection on previous proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [May - July](https://daotalk.org/t/keenan-luke-contributor-proposal-for-05-2021-to-07-2021/2957), things I think I did well include:\n\n* This period I finalized and pushed **DXdocs V1.0** to a very positive initial response. I think there is a lot that can continue to flow into DXdocs as the community begins to utilize it to its full extent, and I am incredibly excited to guide that path forward with our documentation resource. \n\n* **Community calls!** I am incredibly happy with the outcome of changing our resource coordination call to a bi-weekly community call. This has really brought out engagement within the community, and continues grow in success each iteration.\n\n* I also was deeply involved in the process of creating the **DXdao contributor compensation overhaul** including complementary material such as the DXD release and stable release calculator. Although this is yet to see an on-chain vote, discussion (and criticism) have been productive and I am happy with where we are today and where the discussion could continue to move to.\n\n* Finally, **squad leadership and coordination**. I wouldn't consider this perfect, but since the previous proposal where I had formally pushed into an organizational and leadership driven position, the output of DXvoice has increased considerably. DXdao and Swapr Twitter have had their most successful month by a considerable margin, content and other initiatives are more frequent then ever before. This was accomplished through our weekly coordination calls and through the recent squad onboardings.\n\n### Things I think I could improve on:\n\n* I had indicated an interest in beginning the inklings of **thought leadership** in my previous proposal. Although I pushed forward with my community leadership position through Discord leadership, social moderation, and interviews such as DIGIFIZZY and Publish0x; I didn't do much on the thought leadership side of things due to commitment constraints. I still have a serious interest in pursuing thought leadership, but don't want to make any false promises in my proposal provided the time isn't quite right.\n\n* I didn't do enough to **coordinate between squads surrounding timelining**. Although the communication pipeline between squads surrounding marketing has been great, I had not done enough planning ahead for scheduling purposes as my previous proposal stated. This is a tall task with DXdao as a fast moving and ever changing orginization, but more should  have been done here.\n\n## Goals/Responsibilities:\n\n[65%] **Community, Communications, and Marketing**\n\n* Lead DXdao's \"DXvoice\" squad\n  * Organize, run, and manage various initiatives including but not limited to squad calls, marketing processes, community calls, events, content coordination, etc…\n  * Explore the potential for DXvoice to become a more independant entity with its own goals.

Instead, the base template manager now keeps track of all template versions that were ever created so that only the information about the template id and version can be passed to KPI tokens. In the `template` view function of the token it's now sufficient to call the base template manager in order to get template info at a specific version.\n- Moved the KPI token initialization logic to the factory instead of the template manager to save gas.\n- The contracts were slimmed down a little bit logic wise, making them slightly clearer.\n- Used a struct in oracle initialization to avoid stack too deep errors (natspec doc and tests were updated in the process).\n- Implement ownership transfer in ERC20 KPI token and also enforce it in the generic KPI token interface.\n- Added a Foundry script to manually add a template to any given template manager.\n- Improved overall project documentation surrounding the available Foundry tasks/scripts and what generally can be done.\n\nProof [here](https://github.com/carrot-kpi/contracts-v1/commits/main?author=luzzif).\n\nOn the alpha frontend I have:\n\n- Removed the previously featured campaigns\n- Added new featured campaigns\n- Prepared the release of the new versions with the newly featured campaigns.\n- Fixed the public path in the webpack config that was causing issues in the frontend.\n- Upgraded the dependencies.\n\nProof [here](https://github.com/carrot-kpi/frontend/commits/master).\n\nA few changes in the project's overall v1 structure were also made. A monorepo was created with all frontend-related stuff put in one single place. This also helps handling interdependencies as you can work on related projects with less context switches all around. At the same time templates development will be done in separate repositories, as templates can be seen as their own little \"apps\" in the Carrot ecosystem, with the main frontend acting as an orchestrator so to speak.","title":"DAI payout (26/08/2022-25/09/2022) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmXQzrRkyea7dHyL3QyJgMXveZSd2dQDXe7dQhvTYV2T6C"},"0x15285e24f9aa486e541538ad294a9e63c1f1219867613a97c67803cb291c2155":{"description":"\nThis proposal launches a WETH/xDai farming campaign that starts October 14 15:00 UTC and ends October 28 15:00 UTC and distributes 44,800 SWPR tokens over that time period.\n\nREP holders approved the SWPR token and farming campaigns through a[ signal proposal that passed in August](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x2d00135332c28271ba27c6f02f9aa79a480b4d7c58df37fb30e6a55353470910).

[SwaprDAO/cowswapr: A decentralized frontend to trade on Gnosis Protocol v2](https://github.com/SwaprDAO/cowswapr)\n- Creating a development/staging environment for Swapr dapp at [https://swapr.site](https://swapr.site) and [https://analytics.swapr.site](https://analytics.swapr.site). Please note these are exclusively for internal testing. Keep these internal.\n- Fixed issues with Curve support on Ethereum. [swapr-sdk PR #71](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-sdk/pull/71)\n- Fixed all Swapr dapp and SDK unit tests [swapr-dapp PR #664](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pull/664), [swapr-sdk PR #70](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-sdk/pull/70)\n- Contacted GitHub to detach the Swapr repositories from their respective Uniswap forks. \n  \n  ![swapr-detchment|690x125](upload://3M01XM7hKt6A2T9SVRWQwFs9sQr.png)\n\n- Started a new library `@swapr/eco-router` which will have all core eco routing logic. More work on this in the next contributor proposal.\n\n- Wrote a periphery smart contract to support native xDAI <> USDC and xDAI <> USDT trades on Curve on Gnosis Chain. This is planned for audit with Sigma Prime in May. Repo is at [SwaprDAO/swapr-periphery-contracts: A set of contracts to support Swapr Eco Router](https://github.com/SwaprDAO/swapr-periphery-contracts)\n\n- Started helping Atlantis World to integrate Swapr in the 2D metaverse game.\n\n- Actively presented Swapr on the weekly DXdao Dev Community calls, with public notes on [Notion](https://adamazad.notion.site/Swapr-Dev-Community-Call-Highlights-28ffd6905085433ba7a5a4c8fab825e7)\n\n- Helped with DXdao Carrot Twitter campaign API. See [adamazad/dxdao-twitter-carrot-campaign](https://github.com/adamazad/dxdao-twitter-carrot-campaign)\n\nOn top of the above, all my day-to-day duties can be tracked on GitHub:\n\n- [March](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2022-03-01&to=2022-03-31)\n- [April](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2022-04-01&to=2022-04-29)\n\n**DevConnect and ETHAmsterdam Hackathon**\n\n- Been much more active as a DXdao contributor. I networked with a few founders who might reach out to the DAOtalk forums to discuss partnerships. Examples include Valhalla Network and Superfluid.\n- Been to MEV day, and met Ed Felten, founder of Offchain Labs. We discussed decentralizing the sequencer and DXdao could potentially participate as a DAO!\n- We won the hackathon! Our project [Nimi.eth](https://nimi.eth.limo) was a finalist, and it’s a working product in Alpha. My next proposal will devote some time to Nimi and its development roadmap. Already been approached by a few angel investors and VC firms who expressed interest in investing in Nimi.\n\n# Reflections\n\n**Did Well**\n\n- Devoting more time and focus on Swapr\n- Swapr repo organizations and dev environment setups.\n- Swapr developm\n\n**Did Okay**\n\n- Eco Router updates are yet to be implemented in the front-end due to some technical blocks, which I am working on in the next proposal. This includes Curve on GC, and GPv2 due to wrapping and some UX roadblocks. \n\n**Need to improve**\n\n- Swapr releases: our release last release was on March 22nd, 2022; a month + 2 days after Feb 20th release. I do not call this an agile framework at the moment, and definitely looking to improve our releases.\n- Proposals: I am LATE by a good margin this time. 2 months despite being full-time. Also, I tend to bundle payments which are bad for myself as well and add another layer of risk.","title":"Adam Azad - Contributor Proposal March - April 2022 (late) - March payout","hash":"QmWZsSpokg9MChshvX3uT8x2mpQdp3VT4GmkWuwxXZuqws"},"0x1e0a6598ef6f50531472ffbfd7750225194bba953c9e5a5759ef71bd8522da2a":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

The extension on the buyback program was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-program-signal-proposal/2890). This funding proposal and the subsequent trade proposal use an updated version of the GP Relayer than the one referenced in the DXD Buyback Program Signal Proposal in order to add Swapr to the GP Relayer’s exchangeFactoryWhitelist.\n\nThe DXD Buyback Program Signal proposal stipulates that the purchase amount should be based on the DXD Average Daily Trading Volume (ADTV). [According to the most recent on-chain data and estimates](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmU1gB6iJbEgxK2BF9ugmH4LSzmwqSA934jb8Y3aieTwtk), DXD has averaged $134k over the last 3 months, so this proposal sends 12.4 WETH to the GP relayer on xDai, identified as `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`, using a [$2701.88 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum). Further explanation of the [GP relayer can be found here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmd8TCEr6syKxAnmuBH3hsyvxfSgRJgANLTTorp3JGZY77). \n\nThis proposal falls under the DXD Buyback Program, because the value of the DXD circulating supply is less than the value in the ETH in DXdao’s treasury, [according to Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dxdao) and [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521).\n\nThis proposal sends funds to the GP Relayer. A separate proposal with the order parameters must also be submitted to place the order. That proposal must be executed _after_ this proposal or else it will fail.","title":"Send 12.4 WETH to GP Relayer for xDXD buyback #19","hash":"QmTKkbttHVews81b2nzRcqNQA8yxNLWE4hVjtTLZwuYSS7"},"0x21db513e0abbc00114d4875449ba3694a03a38b63fab6fde9a27037e292a9a37":{"description":"This signal proposal aims to reach consensus on the Q4 REP Boost proposal, found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-discord-rep-boosts-q4-2021/3778). Successful passage of this proposal greenlights eligible Discord participants to their respective mainnet REP allocation, to be claimed through GNC.\n\nYou can find the previous signal proposal [here](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/xdai/proposal/0xc7c242ee6854995f9743748eb8aab8c00e2b0f800d24b34e7bfc50cb29561793). Here is an overview of the post:\n\n___\n\n\n## Background\n\nWelcome to 2022! In Q1 of 2021, we've organized a quarterly REP boost that targets community activity and retention. Since then there have been three successful Discord REP boosts, with this fourth boost wrapping up the 2021 year. As usual, this will need to pass through governance as a signal before users are eligible to claim. Here is some context from the original proposal:\n\n> With the introduction of the DXdao Discord server, @KeenanLuke has proposed an initiative to get more community members involved in Governance. A governance gateway drug, if you will. This functions as a quarterly allocation; a way for us to leave the door open to those most active in the community to further involvement with DXdao and its governance.\n\nIn its current configuration, the DXdao Discord server tracks a user's participation in the preceding quarter and assigns a role based on quantity and quality of the engagement. More information explaining this is coming soon directly within Discord.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nThe below list contains all users eligible for a boost, their respective level, and the allocation of mainnet REP they are entitled to receive. Active DXdao contributors are not eligible for this initiative, and have been removed from the list. Anyone nominated for a [traditional community REP boost](https://daotalk.org/t/community-rep-boosts-apr-2021/2850) is still eligible for this initiative, since high levels are difficult to obtain and the REP is distributed quarterly instead of monthly.\n\nAlthough the entitlement is in mainnet REP, it is highly advised that community members request their REP via xDXdao - where governance contract interaction is a fraction of a cent. Anyone is welcome to reach out to @KeenanLuke, or any other community member involved with governance, requesting a small amount of xDai to make their REP request proposal and start voting!\n\nIf no concerns have arisen within a few days of this post being live, @KeenanLuke will create a signal proposal on Gnosis Chain to update this initiative. If the proposal passes, @KeenanLuke will notify those who are eligible and assist in the claiming process by updating the “DXdao Discord REP Boost Guide”. A dedicated channel for the Discord REP boosts will be opened in the Governance category of the DXdao Discord, where eligible participants will be notified.\n","title":"Signal Proposal for DXdao Discord REP Boosts Q4 2021","hash":"Qmazg54jmLnCL4Q3hMKzMjUkXa8HXLncpmSKUNRmtoxWHY"},"0x22b79f808e74a9b07089c907ef75a519e69e84fab0fee98ba5bd46feaf782501":{"description":"This proposal is for a second audit of the Swapr farming contracts.

This “customer service” environment has taught me a variety of soft skills in dealing with stakeholders.\n\nWith my new found love for DXdao and Web3 in general, I plan to bring those skills to bear here at DXdao. Assisting in conveying the message of the DXdao ethos to the world. I will be working within the DXvoice squad. This will be in close collaboration with Keenan and the other DXvoice members. Naturally this will extend out to the broader DXdao contributors, as needed.\n\nPlease Note\n\nDXdao is already engaged in many Marketing and Public Relations initiatives. Key contributors are working on a variety of projects in these areas.\n\nI am not one to “put the horse before the cart”. My knowledge of DXdao’s Marketing and Public Relations is in its infancy. So I will focus on getting a proper understanding of this. To understand what is being done, how it is being done, where it is being done and by who.\n\nSo with respect to the current key contributors and their efforts, I have been conservative in my scope of responsibilities and duties explained here. Once it is clear to me how and where I can contribute, without duplicating work or getting in the way, I will clarify my duties and responsibilities in more detail.\n\nThis in no way will limit my efforts. I am 100% committed to being a team player that will be productive and reliable. I will “jump in” and be ready to help and contribute to what needs doing.\n\nI have completed my first two week trial period and am now moving onto the two month trial period.\n\nI have been and will be working part-time for this entire trial period. I have a contractual obligation to my current employer to provide a notice period of at least three months. Once I have completed this notice period, which should be around the middle of May. I intend to contribute on a full time basis.\n\nAs a side note. Being a part of the more day-to-day operations of DXdao has been everything I imagined it to be and more. It has been exciting and enjoyable to see that which I had read about in operation. Decentralization is happening in DXdao. I am working on meeting all contributors and will continue to send out requests for a call and a short informal chat. I hope you will afford me some time out of your busy schedules.\n\nThank you once again. I welcome any feedback, notes or criticism.\n\nTime frame\n\n2 Week Trial Period - 25.01.2022 - 07.02.2022 (20 hours/week)\n\n2 Month Trial Period - 08.02.2022 - 04.04.2022 (20 hours/week)\n\nGoals\n\nTo get situated within the DXvoice squad and establish:\n\n    Gradually taking over existing operations/campaigns to fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities.\n    Gain a solid understanding of the core message of the DXdao brand and the individual product brands.\n    Get to know the key contributors and their areas of expertise in DXdao.\n\nResponsibilities.\n\nDuring this 10 week period I have been and will continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere.\n\nThis will be in accordance with:\n\n    the Social Highlights Program introduced by @Caden and @KeenanL.\n    the application of the 1:10 post to engagement ratio introduced by @KeenanL\n\nTwitter is one of the primary “news” channels for Web3 participants. It will be instrumental for day-to-day communications of DXdao brand awareness. With existing members and to attract new participants/members/contributors alike.\n\nThe rest of my time will be settling myself within Discord. Usually the next step for those who want more detail and information than can be conveyed on Twitter. I will also focus on bringing my DXproduct knowledge up to speed.\n\nSocial Engagement\n\n    Identify and analyze competitors and complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on Twitter and then Discord. Ongoing.\n    Help increase awareness of DXdao and its products and drive social engagement with the relevant DXdao Twitter accounts through consistent and possibly even daily activity.\n    Explore DXdao history and future to assist in developing an ongoing content generating strategy to add to DXdocs and other mediums deemed acceptable by DXdao. (intended)\n\nGrowth Marketing\n\n    Analyze data and track metrics of tweets to determine what is working and what is not and optimize tweets according to target audience.\n\nCommunications\n\n    Assist with ideating and executing campaigns across owned and other media channels as my awareness and knowledge grows.\n\nCompensation\n\nThis compensation proposal is being submitted in accordance with the current DXdao Worker Guidelines and the current DXdao Pay Structure.\n\nI believe my past experience places me slightly within all the levels from 1-4, mostly 3 & 4. I will thus be starting my contribution at level 3 for the foreseeable future.\n\n***I will only be submitting my proposal for payment at the end of this working period. This is due to ongoing actions on my side regarding legal compliance with receiving payment in crypto. Until everything is set up, I cannot receive payment. It should all be completed during March.***\n\nExperience Level: 3\n\nPart-time.

On the frontend:\n\n- Show common bases on token selection modal when swapping (it was already there in the add liquidity page).\n- Finish implementing airdrop modal, fetching airdrop info from Arbitrum One (whatever network the user is on, Arbitrum One is always queried for airdrop state).\n- Helped test the frontend regarding the SWPR airdrop on Arbitrum Rinkeby testnet.\n- Improve performances on the token picker modal by loading all balances at once through a single multicall call. This makes the whole token modal opening/closing animation smoother and snappier than both Uniswap and Sushiswap.\n- Enabled liquidity mining campaigns creation on Arbitrum One before launch.\n- Make native currency balance pill red if the user has no native currency balance (nothing can be done in the network).\n- Helped implement the new network switcher.\n- Move preview builds on PRs and develop from Netlify to IPFS, making the CI process a bit more decentralized in the process (big thanks to the Aqua team that came up with the GitHub action to do this).\n- Prepare beta 4 release (including code encessary to claim the SWPR airdrop).\n- Helped prepare the [Arbitrum launch plan](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdaos-arbitrum-launch-plan/3232), through which the community helped make SWPR a reality\n\nProof for the claims above can be verified by looking at my commits on `master` [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/commits/master?author=luzzif) and on `develop` [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/commits/develop?author=luzzif).\n\nAlso implemented a generalized version of eco-routing with the first implementation being a 0x integration, exclusively on mainnet.

DXD holders will now be able to claim their share of unlocked SWPR directly from the frontend.\n- After the adjustement of the DXD airdrop snapshot date, Uniswap v3 LPs on mainnet were also taken into consideration among others.\n- Generated Merkle trees and roots for both the smart contract and EOA leaves.\n- Made the SWPR token burnable (at least on mainnet).\n\nProof about the token/airdrop improvements can be found [here](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-token-contracts/commits/master).","title":"DAI payout (26/07/2021-26/08/2021) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmYDcYPdcr8c28enS3phTujVi7KqpC7cDaSGZdcPr1Mopw"},"0x5c359c753078ab50c91fce84060201e8c3cbc7ac3c737e7f77b1fe2a9f8461ba":{"description":"\nThis proposal launches a HAUS/WETH farming campaign that starts Thu Nov 25th 2021 at 15:00 and ends Thu Dec 9th 2021 at 15:00; distributing 8,400 SWPR tokens over that time period.\n\nREP holders approved the SWPR token and farming campaigns through a[ signal proposal that passed in August](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x2d00135332c28271ba27c6f02f9aa79a480b4d7c58df37fb30e6a55353470910).

There’s been an underlying tension since summer 2020; DXdao was launched with a purely Reputational-based governance structure, but, last May, DXdao launched a [bonding curve and the DXD token ](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x11bfab6550819de6300aa60204eb4b4112323853c0073c9a22c8aba7fd3b8f27)to raise funds. DXD holders funded the treasury, but have no say in governance decisions as of now.\n\nThe goal of the Gov 2.0 WG was to structure a system that aligns the interests of REP and DXD holders, can build and grow DeFi products and protocols, and maintains the ethos from DXdao’s launch and those principles laid out in the [DXdao manifesto](https://dxdao.eth.link/#/manifesto). In the initial meetings, the working group identified the [Solution Requirements](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYLyzmcuuDF9nJ6W7gKiDATRYWgATfiaNbdTBSP9enRDK) for a new system.\n\nThis signal proposal is the culmination of those efforts and aims to lay out the structure for a new governance structure. Not everything has been specified and DXdao governance and technical development will be charged with building a fully-functioning system within the bounds outlined in this proposal.\n\nThere are three main components of Gov 2.0:\n\n* A new voting power equation\n* Good governance incentives\n* Migration process to new system\n\n# New Voting Power Equation\n\nThis is the crux of the Gov 2.0 system as it completely changes who has ultimate power in DXdao. At the moment, proposals are passed purely based on the amount of REP for and REP against. The new system will incorporate DXD into a new calculation for voting power. In this system, both DXD and REP are required to vote or have influence in DXdao.\n\nTo calculate a DXdao member’s “Voting Power”, we must:\n\n* Come up with a “DXD Influence” and “REP Influence” & normalize these scores\n* Assign weights and add them together\n\n### DXD Influence\n\nHolding DXD does not require governance participation. To have influence and increase one’s voting power, the DXD must be staked in pools identified by DXdao governance. Additionally, one can increase their DXD Influence by future commitments to DXD staking.\n\nThe inputs to DXD Influence are:\n\n* (X) DXD staked - as LPs in DXdao products or in a governance staking contract\n  * Multipliers can be adjusted by governance to (dis)incentivize certain LPs. Only DXD is counted (if LPing)\n  * Max: 1,500 DXD (adjustable by governance)\n* (X0) Future months committed\n  * proposed equation = (X0/6)^B\n  * Staking is committed for X0 months; Max 36 months (adjustable by governance)\n  * B = some power below 1 (adjustable by governance); higher = favors longer-term investors\n  * 6 = ‘schelling point’ of expected commitment. 6 months of future commitment gives an output of 1.\n\nProposed DXD Influence equation:\n\n* X * (X0/6)^0.75\n* DXD staked * (Future months/6)^0.75\n* Adjustable by governance: B (initially set at 0.75)\n\n### REP Influence\n\nREP is earned for contributions to DXdao. Since it is non-transferable and can be slashed, it is more sybil resistant. At the moment, most REP is held by workers and those who participated in the original staking period, but this should be expanded widely and reward a host of positive contributions, such as liquidity provisioning.\n\nSince REP is non-transferable, those with REP may maintain influence even after they’ve stopped contributing. Gov 2.0 introduces a decay function to address this. Moreover, since the current social consensus on a “max 4% REP” is intended to limit a single member’s influence, we can codify this in the voting power equation, which allows REP to scale and be used for non-voting purposes.\n\nREP Influence:\n\n* Y = Reputation issued to address; max: 4%\n* Y0 = Months since last REP issuance\n* Decay function = 1-(Y0/24)^D\n  * D = some power > 1 will give a slower decay in the first year of inactivity, and faster in the second year.\n  * Minimum output: 0.05\n* Proposed REP Influence equation:\n  * Y * (1-(Y0/24)^1.5)\n  * Reputation * (1-(Months since last REP issuance/24)^1.5\n  * Adjustable by governance: power D (initially set at 1.5), min output (initially 0.05)\n\nThe output of DXD Influence and REP Influence will then be normalized to the same scale. The precise method of normalization is left up to technical implementation, but the consensus of the working group is that the scores should be normalized after the DXD/REP Influence calculation and on those primitives that are participating in governance, perhaps periodically adjusted.\n\n### Combining REP Influence and DXD Influence\n\nThe two normalized scores must then be combined to form a single number for a DXdao’s member’s Voting Power. Assigning explicit weights to REP Influence and DXD Influence gives transparency into how the votes are calculated. Even though these normalized scores are added together, the consensus of the working group was that members participating in governance must have both DXD and REP (minimum amounts determined by governance).\n\nTo combine normalized influence scores, a % weight should be applied to each. The weights may change over time, so the Gov 2.0 WG is proposing a bounded range along with initial weights.\n\nProposed bounded range:\n\n* DXD Influence: min 35%, max 65%\n* REP Influence: min 35%, max 65%\n\nInitial Voting Power Weights:\n\n* DXD influence: 50%\n* REP influence: 50%\n\nOverall Influence Max: the new voting power equation has a REP max and a DXD max, but there is not a consideration for the overall max influence for an address. This is challenging to map out now, because DXD Influence is dependent on the amount of DXD staked in governance. DXdao governance structure aims to prevent accumulation of power in a single address. In implementing this proposal, additional research into a mechanism to create an overall maximum for influence in the voting power equation may be needed to maintain the goal of decentralization.\n\n# Good Governance Incentives\n\nGovernance takes time and resources. In the current system, holographic consensus provides a financial award to those that ‘boost’ proposals by staking a token on proposals they expect to pass. A boosted proposal can pass in an expedited time without a majority vote. This is meant to focus voters’ attention on only the most important proposals.\n\nWhile there is an incentive to boost proposals, there is no incentive for members to vote on “good proposals”. Currently, some REP holders are constantly monitoring proposals to make sure worker proposals, market curation and other items pass but this is done primarily by full-time contributors and mostly for altruistic reasons.\n\nGovernance takes time; it should be rewarded and incentivized. Gov 2.0 WG identified three governance incentives in a new system:\n\n* Rewards to DXD staked in governance\n* Retroactive governance ‘bonuses’ - on quarterly, half-year or annual basis, reflect on “good proposals” and reward the proposer AND those who voted in support\n* Incentivized Representatives - selected DXdao members (not full-time contributors) who are rewarded for voting on proposals. These are selected by DXdao governance and their voting record will be reviewed to ensure they are not voting blindly for rewards.\n\nThe ideal form of reward is vested DXD. DXdao governance may also decide to allocate product fees in lieu of (or on top of) DXD rewards.\n\n# Migration process to a new system\n\nREP holders currently control DXdao governance decisions by vote on the Ethereum blockchain. This includes control of the $35m DXdao treasury and the 100k DXD pre-mint. Since the launch of the bonding curve in May 2020, DXD holders have funded the treasury with purchases from the curve, but they currently have no governance voting rights. REP and DXD holders currently function as separate groups, but in order to align stakeholder interests and promote further decentralization, both groups will be migrated into the same voting system, which includes an allocation of REP and DXD to balance the alignment of interests. To kickstart the migration process and cede control of the treasury:\n\n\n### DXD Distribution\n10,000 DXD from the pre-mint will be proportionally distributed to REP holders, with a 3-year vesting cliff.\n\n**Base Distribution**\n\n* REP holders that have voted once before the Snapshot will receive 3 DXD.\n* The Snapshot will occur six (6) months from the Signal Proposal’s passage.\n* At maximum, 2,000 DXD will be allocated in the Base Distribution.\n* If more than 633 addresses qualify for Base Distribution at the time of the Snapshot, then 2,000 DXD will be distributed evenly amongst all qualifying addresses.\n\n**Proportional Distribution**\n\n* The following REP holders are eligible for a Proportional DXD distribution.\n  * REP holders that have voted at least three (3) times before the passage of the Governance 2.0 Signal Proposal; \n    * The snapshot of REP holders that have voted at least three (3) times will occur within twenty-four (24) hours of the Signal Proposal’s passage on the DXdao Alchemy.io mainnet.\n\n    *OR*\n \n  * New REP Holder addresses that submit a passing proposal on mainnet, xDAI, or any other authorized DXdao governance base. “New REP Holder addresses” include any ETH address that receives REP for the first time from August 1, 2020 onward.\n    * The Snapshot of New REP Holders will occur at least six (6) months from the Governance 2.0 Signal Proposal’s passage.\n\n* Proportional Distribution Calculation\n  * Qualifying REP holders will receive vested DXD proportional to their Mainnet REP % at the time of the Snapshot (DXD Amt = Mainnet REP % x (10,000 DXD - total Base Distribution)).\n  * Example:\n    * Qualifying REP holder has 1.5% REP on mainnet at time of Snapshot.\n    * 200 REP addresses on mainnet qualify for the Base Distribution.\n    * 200 REP x 3 DXD = 600 DXD\n    * 10,000 DXD - 600 DXD = 9,400 DXD\n    * .015 x 9,400 = 141 DXD\n* REP holders can claim either Base Distribution or Proportional Distribution, but not both.\n\nTiming\n\n* The DXD distribution will occur before REP inflation is allocated to DXD holders, as described in the below “REP Inflation Allocation” section.\n\nSix (6)-Month Claim Period\n\n* DXD must be proactively claimed within 6 months of the Governance 2.0 DXD Distribution. After six (6) months from the Governance 2.0 DXD Distribution, unclaimed DXD will be returned to DXdao’s treasury.\n\nVesting Schedule\n\n* DXD will be vested for three (3) years from when the Gov 2.0 system is implemented. The vesting contract should retain the ability to revoke DXD distribution to addresses that don’t act in accordance with DXdao’s Contributor Guidelines and overall best interests.\n\nDXD Governance Usage\n\n* This allocated DXD may be used prior to the 3-year vesting cliff in the Governance 2.0 staking equation, outlined above.\n\n### REP Inflation Allocation\n\nREP will be inflated by 5% and distributed in the following manner:\n\n* 4% to DXD holders, proportional to the address’s percentage of DXD circulating supply. This snapshot should take place at the time of Governance 2.0 signal proposal passage, but distribution will happen at Governance 2.0 system implementation. The snapshot should account for DXD in liquidity pools by using the amount of DXD in the pool at the time of snapshot.\n* 1% to addresses that bought DXD from the bonding curve. REP awards are the amount of DXD bought from the curve from an address divided by the total amount of DXD bought from the curve. This distribution will occur at Governance 2.0 system implementation.\n\nIn addition to the proposed 5% inflation to DXD holders, some REP may be awarded to DXD holders that participat in the DXD ERC20 Guild.\n\nAdditional REP inflation may be airdropped to addresses that have shown governance capabilities in other projects on Ethereum.\n\n## Implementation\nThis Governance 2.0 Signal Proposal encompasses the general structure and design of the new DXdao Governance system that sustainably intertwines REP and DXD into a single voting power equation. The implementation of the Governance 2.0 Signal Proposal will foreseeably require additional technical assessment in order to properly execute its details. This technical assessment will inevitably include unknown considerations that are outside of the scope of the Governance 2.0 Signal Proposal.\n\nAdditionally, unforeseen events and/or realizations may come to the attention of the DXdao community, which may require further consideration in the execution of the Governance 2.0 Signal Proposal. DXdao reserves the right to reasonably make changes to this proposal, with community input and consensus, where new material information or events are discovered or occur. This flexibility allows the DXdao community to account for unforeseen developments. The implementation process should still abide by the text and spirit of this proposal to the extent possible.","title":"Governance 2.0 Signal Proposal","hash":"QmXYu98oTrRQ5bTr6Qt9wuHed44prdiDGeBT2tfx8EBp3Z"},"0x8b35f6a2d7e8cd3622f5cf4403a6affe086db1227ac0792875fec0739b543a3c":{"description":"ETHworks has been subcontracting to Level K, and working in support of Swapr.

This is the first of (2) multi-call proposals and relies on (2) prior funding proposals**\n\n## Background\n\nContinuing the implementation of the Approved New DXD Token Model, this post is a proposal to deploy additional WETH/DXD liquidity on Swapr on GnosisChain, totalling approximately (1)5 WETH and 35.565 DXD.\n\nOne of the implementation provisions of the New DXD token model was to use DXdao treasury assets to increase DXD liquidity. It committed up to $1m of DXD/ETH. The proposal authorizes liquidity to be provisioned once the DXD Treasury NAV ratio surpasses 60%. The latest calculation is 68%.\n\nSo far, 130 ETH and 300 DXD have been allocated on mainnet and sent to the DXSwap relayer to be deployed, of which approximately 57.7 ETH and 152 DXD have been deployed. The remaining allocation on mainnet will be deployed separately from this proposal, with the total adding up to approximately $400,000 in liquidity (depending on price).\n\nThe Swapr DXD/WETH liquidity pool on GnosisChain is currently pretty thin, with only ~11.5 ETH and ~27 DXD, totaling roughly $34,000 in liquidity. Over half the liquidity was recently removed. Given the strategic importance of GnosisChain to the DAO, we believe that the treasury should add liquidity to this pool to improve the ability of DAO participants and others to more effectively interact with it.\n\n15 WETH is a little less than half of the available WETH on the GnosisChain treasury\n\n## Details/Implementation\n\nWe propose depositing 15 WETH and 35.565 DXD liquidity over 4 transactions to the Swapr WETH/DXD liquidity pool on Gnosis Chain.\n\n- Proposal 1 would send 15 WETH from the DXD GnosisChain treasury to the DXSwap relayer.\n- Proposal 2 would send 36 DXD from the DXD GnosisChain treasury to the DXSwap relayer.\n\nThose 2 transactions would be proposed concurrently using the Funding and Voting Power Scheme and upon passing would be followed up with 2 multi-call proposals, separated a day apart. We are proposing 2 transactions due to the low liquidity in the pool to prevent manipulation.\n\n- Proposal 3 would add 6 ETH and 14.4 DXD in liquidity to the pool.\n- Proposal 4 would add 9 ETH and 21.6 DXD in liquidity to the pool.\n\nAll liquidity addition transactions would have a 5% slippage tolerance, but due to fluctuating prices, less of 1 asset may get added to the pool. Remaining assets in the DXSwap relayer can be removed back into the DXdao treasury via an optional 5th proposal.\n\nOnce completed, these transactions will be added to the running total of DAO owned liquidity and tracked as the DAO continues to execute on the New Token Model.\n\n## Notes, Risks, and Considerations\n\n- Note on Treasury NAV: This liquidity provision was approved as part of the new DXD Token Model, but there was not specifics on how it affects Treasury NAV. Many projects do not include protocol-owned liquidity as part of treasury calculation, but for clarification, the ETH in the DXD/ETH LP position counts toward Treasury NAV, but the DXD in it does not count towards circulating supply\n- Impermanent loss is a risk for all 50/50 constant-product automated market makers. That should be limited here because of the higher fee as well as the price range that DXD/ETH should trade in. Using the Swapr Liquidity Relayer comes with its own set of risks as it relates to oracle manipulation. Breaking the deposit amounts down into smaller increments makes it more expensive to manipulate.\n- Lastly, Due to how Automated Market Makers work, new DXD will enter the circulating supply should the price of DXD/ETH go above what the pool was deposited at. This issuance would be offset by more ETH “owned by the treasury” and thus shouldn’t have a large effect on NAV calculations, but DXdao should be mindful of this.\n","title":"ETH/DXD Liquidity - Deposit 6 WETH and 14.4 DXD (1/2)","hash":"QmZZsCEVtPhDmDm8VEsQakvjn3caiKr8nLce8A3VLQZ3Tv"},"0x9068730f250cf02238b5db3311a54b2f42a9e237eb95632efe8ad1ba03895654":{"description":"\n    \nThis proposal places a 4 WETH order on CowSwap for DXD.

From this we did more releases publicly testing out update formats.\n  * **Public beta** - The public beta was defined as going onto production networks which went less well. We managed to get DAVI into a production state just for devcon but unfortunately did not have the time to deploy and set up all the guilds we wanted to show off. However, this should be complete before the end of October and hopefully better communication than we could have managed during the chaos of devcon.\n\nAn extra thanks to Kenny and the entire team for helping to refine our release process, excited for where this will go!\n\n* **Contracts off to audit** - Coordinating with omega to get 1.5 contracts off to audit is a big step to having DXdao move to DAVI and then supporting gov 2.0. Great work here by Augusto and the entire team for getting involved with smart contract development. https://daotalk.org/t/dxgov-governance-1-5-contracts-audit/4553\n* **Public speaking** - Aside from my panel in Denver and an online panel shortly after I have not done any public speaking so I was pretty nervous leading up to the daoist in Bogota. I put a lot of time into the talk “Overlooked: Accessible Autonomy” on my flight over and thanks to Boris I got some awesome slides prepared. The talk went really well and I am looking forward to doing more speaking in the future. (Will post the video here once it is available)\n* **Retreat** - This retreat whilst far from relaxing was incredibly productive and I feel I was able to communicate and add to the discussions in a very meaningful way. I cant wait to see these discussions turn into actions and I am super grateful to everyone I had great conversations with. It was my honour to be a part of formalising the vision of DXdao: “Enable community freedom”\n* **Testing new processes** - As we approach production there is a lot we can improve about how we work and manage products. One of the first steps is testing out canny which seems to work well as a place to track roadmap features and get feedback from users: https://davi.canny.io/\n\n**Did ok:**\n\n* **Partnerships** - Over Devcon we further increased partnerships although have not followed through on any yet, mostly due to the still early stage of the product. Orbis is an example of this going well as we met up in Devcon to plan our partnership and further integration in DAVI. Having the biz dev team meet with them was also great and I hope more like this can happen as we have more to show.\n* **DAVI architecture** - I spent a good amount of time discussing with the team how we are tackling support for 1.5 in DAVI settling on a subgraph with contract reads as a backup. I also had great architecture talks with Orbis about how we can effectively merge social aspects with governance. I do however want to solidify these architectures more in writing.\n* **2.0 planning** - There was less time in the retreat than I thought there would be for technical discussion in squads but we did find time to run through plans for the voting machine architecture and discussed many tough problems and came up with some solutions. Still more to do here.\n* **DAVI branding** - Working with Dirk on branding for the DAVI landing page has been awesome and I am so glad we have such amazing talent in DXdao. I put it in ok simply because there was not enough time to properly coordinate with DXvoice on marketing or publication efforts using some of this new branding.\n\n**Could have done better:**\n\n* **Coordination between squads** - Just a general reflection that is a larger problem recently identified and voiced in DXdao but part of that also falls on me. With the restructuring and everything done at the retreat, we are moving towards a way of working that more naturally encourages this so I am hopeful we can all do better here.\n* **IPFS solutions** - Ideally I was wanting to further this initiative of DAO infrastructure to decentralise our storage solutions but I really just didn’t find the time. I had thought about hacking a dappnode project on infinite hackathons but had no time with mentoring plus preparing my talk. But the idea is still super awesome, I’m hopeful I can find some time for it soon.\n* **Distractions** - A lot went on in the DAO over this period and I think it took up way too much of my bandwidth for a while. Caring about the direction of the DAO while continuing daily tasks can be tough.\n\n**Salary**\nI took two half days travelling to my residency appointment and back, covered by one day per month in contributor guidelines\nI then took 4 half days when my family was visiting and one more full day off after to spend time with my girlfriend.\nThis comes to 3 days off during this period so I am calculating this at 85% worked at level 6.\nPayment will be done through DevX and so sent in another proposal collating many months of approved worker proposals. \n\nI am also requesting the rest of my Colombia stipend, initial hotel and flights can be found here:\nhttps://dxgovernance.github.io/dxvote/#/xdai/proposal/0xf9c734fc5b130330e1925c137a3bc4c5c31d3c66e620735cc4b6cab641a4d41c\nDaily stipend $75*15 = $1125\nDevcon ticket = $300\n\nUSD: 8000*0.85 = $6800\nDXD: $6000*0.85 = $5100 of DXD\nREP: (0.1667%=3640)*0.85 = 3094","title":" Ross Neilson Worker Proposal 18/8/2022-18/10/2022 2/2","hash":"QmSjihbK3dRGZkxcDuC9U5865AEisG28vVZfB97KuBmNnk"},"0x9095e4ac4d5cbda35399e34a648ce15b93b30eb145ca6ee557555c9d7263c2ca":{"description":"This proposal is to fund a bounty program for translations of Project- DAVI for $250 per language.

This is their 12th proposal. The proposal below is a payout for November 2022 totaling $8,704. Below is a recap of the contributions along with links to a Master Service Agreement and Scope of Work that govern the relationship going forward. These are written as contractual agreements between DXdao and Space Inch. Passage of this proposal is a “signature” from DXdao to those agreements.\n\nTimeframe\n\nNovember 1 - 30, 2022\n\nResponsibilities\n\nOskar (karczuRf):\nOskar in November has been focusing mainly on two big features: upgrade wallet library and LP-Zapping.\n\nThe first one was about integrating the newest version of web3-react library to fix plenty of bugs and improve user experience while using Swapr. The task is completed, so the code was reviewd and checked with approvals. Currently is ready to be merged. The PR can be found on Swapr-dapp github repo: feature/upgrade-wallet-library by karczuRF · Pull Request #1330 · levelkdev/swapr-dapp · GitHub.\n\nThe second task LP-Zapping is brand new feature in Swapr. It allows to swap any token for 2 different tokens and add liquidity to the pool with just 1-click. It works also in another direction, so allows to remove liquidity from the pool and swap pool’s tokens to any different token, obviously also with 1-click. It is worth mentioning that zap feature is innovative as allows to use any DEX supported by Swapr, so with EcoRouter zapping is cost optimized and flexible. It is also prepared to use it with new DEXs if needed. To achieve it Oskar by himself has written brand new Zap smart contract (with test) and deployed it on Goerli testnet and Gnosis network. Also he fully adjusted Swapr frontend to use Zap contract, so dedicated designs and user-flow components were added. Currently Zap feature is waiting to be tested by QA and reviewed. The PR can be found on Swapr-dapp github repo: Feat/lp zapping by karczuRF · Pull Request #1596 · levelkdev/swapr-dapp · GitHub.\n\nIn the meanwhile Oskar was doing daily routines, like reviewing the code or discussing project development.\n\nMarek Kowalski:\nMarek handles code reviews, project oversight and architectural proposals.\n\nJosh Segall:\nJosh provides general oversight and strategic advice about roadmaps, product, and process.\n\nCompensation\n\nWork Completed from November 1 - 30, 2022\n\nTotal Price = $8,704\n\nLink to Master Services Agreement and Scope of Work 2\n\nLink to SOW for Project #2 Development Work Proposal for Space Inch - Project #2\n\nExperience\n\nSpace Inch started in 2010 by making mobile games and produced 90 million installs of original and published games. Now Space Inch primarily works as an outsource technology partner and consultant to various clients. Space Inch has offices in Nashville, Spain, Poland and Croatia. Space Inch’s services include strategic consulting, UI/UX design, discovery/scoping, architectural planning, engineering, and quality assurance. https://spaceinch.com/ 1","title":"Space Inch Development Work November 2022","hash":"QmdamVRFVdM1HdBw3xYWYEMN966MhVKietwVu14gRQt1K7"},"0x92830eaf6fcd3ec629722522b8da75e3c759b5b45d858fee473b6e67ae062297":{"description":"LNLHB.com Worker Proposal 4/15/2021- 6/15/2021\n\n**Background:**\nThis is the worker proposal for LNLHB.com, @kermit4 on Keybase.  I have already completed my 2 week trial at DXdao,  and this proposal will outline the first two months of my contributions as a Solidity Developer.  For the moment, I will be contributing primarily to Omen. \nI have been in contact with @JohnKelleher and @AugustoL at DXDao in regards to filling this role.\n\n**Timeframe:**\n- 4/15/2021 - 6/15/2021\n- My 2 week trial period was completed from 4/2/21 - 4/15/21.  Details of my trial period and proposal can be found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/chris-pearson-lnlhb-com-developer-proposal/2813).\n\n**Proposed Scope of Contribution:**\n- Security review of Omen guild contracts \n- Read several proposals, about DAOStack, DXDao, Omen, Governance 2.0, AMM, Reality.io, Gnosis, Holographic Consensus, DXDao participation agreement, Contributor Hub, Contributor Guidelines, Hardhat, the Buyback program, DXDao Manifesto, US tax implications of this, \n- Try to understand Omen scalar markets\n- Set up necessary accounts to route XDAI to more widely accepted currency\n- Attend daily meetings\n- Buy some DXD\n- Learn how the ERC20Guild contract works (so in part how DXDGuild works)\n- Work with Kaden and Augusto on OMNGuild smart contract testing and development\n- - https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/commit/a40235b6f90873bc8904bc524abbe1a81a39e63f\n- - https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/commit/3f04d9dd1470d3fa3a78c32026e9d9a806ae7c3a\n- - https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/pull/1/commits\n- - https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/pull/4/commits\n- - https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/pull/7/commits\n- Write tests for @KadenZipfel's staking contracts\n- Work with @martinkrung on Mesa smart contracts.\n- Pre-audit contracts before being sent for final audits ( check off this list https://blog.sigmaprime.io/solidity-security.html  and try to exploit) \n \n \n**Self Reflection on Trial:**\n    My first few weeks of contributing to DXdao was challenging, yet rewarding.  I believe I did well at getting up to speed at learning most aspects of Omen and DXdao, and was able to start contributing to the test writing for the Omen guild promptly alongside Augusto.  However, I need to more proactively seek out deliverables  and assistance by asking more established members what they need help with or what they can help with, as there is no end to information in this ecosystem that could consume my attention if not tied to deliverables.\n\n**Compensation:**\n- Experience Level: 5\n- Time commitment: Full-time\n- [12800 DAI] : For 2 months of work at level 5, to be sent half on the first payment proposal and half on the second payment proposal(at 80%)\n- [18.36 DXD] : Vested for 2 years with a 1 year cliff starting the (at 80%)\n- [4121.6 REP]: For 2 months of work, to be sent half on the first payment proposal and half on the second payment proposal( 0.1667% REP at 80%)  \n\n**Work Experience:**\n- Worker Trial Proposal 4/2/21 - 4/15/21\n- Trial period work for DXdao\n- - OmenGuild tests https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/commit/a40235b6f90873bc8904bc524abbe1a81a39e63f\n- My most recent resume can be found [here](http://azai.net/resume/)\n","title":"LNLHB.com Worker Proposal 4/15/2021- 6/15/2021","hash":"QmQYdAptuQL7igvci942SzYdfe1jp2TcQA4eAYmtaZb52S"},"0x92a7f710917174b7f5d700550cb7aecf244dfb8fd7c7ce31674aa294dcb8dd2c":{"description":"**Timeframe**\n\nJanuary 24 2022 to March 18 2022, 2 months\n\n**Background and Responsibilities**\n\nI will continue filling my position as a part time contributor within the Contributor UX Squad, as an assistant to Melanie.

My previous work with the DAO can be easily seen and judged by looking at my past payment proposals (even though I'm behind on them, those that have been submitted all include a proof of work):\n\n- [02/25/2022-03/25/2022](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0xe58de69a3efbf10c6c6404809eefda104ceea83dc32e196cac04f20d3c046107)\n- [01/25/2022-02/25/2022](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0xb4ce4e8c930b5e18df3b9901ce6179b4e20f3a78e23271f73bc7bbe986f2edeb)\n- [11/25/2021-01/25/2022](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0x3ce7fa66712dd044edd690f0845771c742b5f0f415a445863d5ddd3881377775)\n- [10/25/2021-11/25/2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0x16caebacf5fe49585dd25399006f1a2efdb26da67ed41999845c801865aac1e8)\n- [09/25/2021-10/25/2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0x0048ff80a698fdc8eaa8cca00bd92f5bf93ba29d85446815a6465ec09d45988a)\n- [08/25/2021-09/25/2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0x7dc5c01821733f0527d62be2fbe23f68d886baa82aeea9a6c7720fdd98fb806c)\n- [07/25/2021-08/25/2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0x5b66417d019e288ba85636fd35f6d766b398407680924fc23baf860787be7b48)\n- [06/25/2021-07/25/2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0x30691498524c66efd6ead5e9b039ca2ddbf30ec4b7a9db24cc7520a594184236)\n- [05/25/2021-06/25/2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0x20a4cde9a71e767526dd73ae67d108dbdd5b39b023e8ad9c85a03add31d5cc1d)\n- [04/25/2021-05/25/2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0x20c2d20f6201e1f92ee1b72d88165634cb35626f3a7cdc3041fff6b73ea2a28e)\n- [03/25/2021-04/25/2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0xb8e57bc8313db906677fcb06530ad67f1392829de13dccee839ee3311c02facd)\n- [02/25/2021-03/25/2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0x694cb019e59e5ff4587e959cd02773364d9068cba2414a592e3eaead425d6035)\n- [01/25/2021-02/25/2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0xc3050afc44931813599d7e6e2f003f76af6736c1bdebdc37c26a32a6f3d0854d)\n- [12/25/2020-01/25/2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xdc9800d7ed2dd8f3fe704aa067a14f3b18750374b4f9882da51cf99d495b2817)\n- [11/25/2020-12/25/2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xf187e4d6a57a84ee752af49edb99336253cb168807cfa0a600496db6a4d08433)\n- [10/25/2020-11/25/2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x9f6fadf9a43e28bb6563b212fdd1d5113761b151d402d9e280fcb1071cc03fb0)","title":"Worker proposal - 26/07/2022 to 25/09/2022 - luzzifoss","hash":"QmWT3T72JFaVww2yHvD4jaQ34u9sCdiwx7dbjMoWVhXfov"},"0x94a9ddfb24b5a6a41470d83066410c965774189bb230ce15c9d163582aaf90a1":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal sends 7.87 WETH to the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions) intended to be used to place an order to purchase xDXD in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was originally passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45), and extended for another $1m to $3m total, through a further proposal which also passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x56c66f99d87a48d707475aa2466f0a58da13bd744475410957d6572b439cc5bf).

A separate proposal with the order parameters must also be submitted to place the order. That proposal must be executed _after_ this proposal or else it will fail.\n\n**Note:** This proposal sends an additional 3.05 WETH to the GP relayer - due to some previous orders being placed at a higher amount of WETH than sent in the funding proposal.","title":"Send 8.41 WETH to GP Relayer for xDXD buyback #67 (+3.05 WETH for previous orders)","hash":"Qmc4AyZhFR7wvvD5pkqDTtkB52P5QRurSNDghJDHU15QL2"},"0x969e987d96dc89314e40d229c502434066a15dfb94269c1371ef23cdd4847ec7":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

There have been a number of varying ideas for structure and ways to implement.  \n\nOverall, the feeling has been that the exact structure to start is not the critical factor, but that getting things going would be the best path to start experimenting and learning what works.  \n\n**Launch InitiativeDAO**\n\nTo kick things off, the creation of a Mutlisig on xDai for InitiativeDAO was generated.  This MS is only a stepping stone to get things moving before learning what the best DAo structure will be for InitiativeDAO.\n\nThe xDai Multisig can be found here:\nhttps://gnosis-safe.io/app/xdai:0xe043Fe494c29709b83162412bE07EC7ceB79d798/balances\n\nCurrent signers 2 of 4 (can be expanded and evolve)\n- Sky\n- Keenan\n- Powers\n- Nathan\n\nInitiativeDAO has the potential to take its own path and expand outside of the DXdao ecosystem.  As part of the experiment we will learn and track how something can go from idea, to post, to discussion, to MS, to action, to DAO, to more.\n\n**Delegation:**\nInitiativeDAO has a desire to be able to move small, but move fast.  In order to achieve this, some immediate decision making power is being delegated to the initial InitiativeDAO.  All additional input is valued as well.\n\n**Process:**\nInitiators (people who have an idea and want to receive funding to try that idea out quickly) can “propose” an idea to InitiativeDAO consisting of:\n- General outline of the idea (a few sentences) \n- What it seeks to accomplish (a few sentences)\n- Funding need (general range is likely 500-1500 wxDAI)\n\nIn discussions, it became clear that it would be smart to set some general guidelines to govern this initiative.  \n\n**General Guidelines:**\n- Don’t break any laws\n- Initiatives should not be offensive or in bad taste\n- Initiatives should reflect the core values of DXdao (See DXdao Manifesto)\n\nIt is important to protect against any malicious use of InitiativeDAO funds.  InitiativeDAO will not set hard rules for who can request funds from the DAO, but IntiativeDAO will factor in parameters such as community participation, REP holdings, familiarity when granting funds to Initiators.  \n\n**Follow-up requirement:**\nFollowing an Initiators initiative, the Initiators is required to post a summary of the initiative the the DXdao forum.  This should include:\n- Details of the Initiative\n- Evaluation of the Initiative \n- Return on Investment (“ROI”) of the Initiative\n- Plan for going forward\n\n**Funding Request**\nThis proposal requests to allocate 10,000 wxDAI to the InitiativeDAO Multisig.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe hope is that this experiment will help discover new innovative ways to drive value to DXdao.\nThis initiative helps overcome one problem-child of DAOs - small, smart ideas lose steam quickly and often because they are not worth putting through the “DAO process”. \nInitiativeDAO solves this.\n\n**Proposal Summary **\nSend 10,000 wxDAI to the InitiativeDAO Multisig at address: 0xe043Fe494c29709b83162412bE07EC7ceB79d798\n \n \n \n \n","title":"REDO: Create and Fund InitiativeDAO to Start Experimenting {Funding Proposal}","hash":"QmSjPJYtxu2wSNz7v4ewyTKhKhE18UjsgzHHGjbYQFzHMc"},"0x977ac4bcfe35f7fbd3b25fc8146ad33cff25b4c21f7d614a2b0e133dd382efea":{"description":"Timeframe\n\nAugust 1st 2022 to September 30th 2022, 2 months\n\nResponsibilities and Self Reflection\n\nI am continuing my position as a part time contributor within the ContributorX Squad.

My calculations on my old sheet for 2020/2021 DXD ended up being incorrect for a lot of contributors, and I didn’t see my mistakes until this past month when contributors began their vesting proposals. These are mistakes I should have caught sooner, way before a proposal was passed on chain approving the incorrect numbers! The mistakes were most likely calculation errors as I was doing things manually – this has led me to start re-thinking my process for collecting and calculating data for contributors. Clearly doing things manually can lead to mistakes – going forward I am going to spend more time learning how to automate processes as well as learn how to use excel/google sheets in a more accurate manner. On a better note, the Contributor Review went splendidly this go around, and I have a feeling it will just keep getting better!

(“Opolis”), with 475,197 $WORK coming as rewards for the contribution; 20% vested/unlocked and 80% vesting over 4 years. Future $WORK tokens that would represent 0.33% equity in Opolis, upon any sale, merger, or liquidation of Opolis at the time of the transaction. \n\n**Background** \n\nIn February 2021, DXdao community members proposed the creation of a DXdao venture arm, named DXventures. Community members adopted the idea, and DeFi projects began to contact DXdao regarding investment opportunities. Opolis approached DXdao to participate in Opolis’s Genesis Coalition as a grant investor. \n\nOpolis is a digital employment cooperative that offers independent workers fully portable benefits, payroll, and shared services. Opolis was created in order to provide contractors in the cryptocurrency space means by which to navigate the concerns that arise when handling health insurance, payroll, and tax issues while being paid in cryptocurrencies. Opolis was founded in Denver, Colorado, and currently focuses its cooperative membership services within the United States, and it also has plans to expand outside of the United States in the next one to two years.  \n\nOpolis, a Delaware corporation, is the funding and launching arm of the Employment Commons, LCA (“Commons”), a Colorado cooperative. Members can join the Commons to receive a variety of contractor-related benefits and use $WORK tokens to stake, use in governance, and hold ownership of the Commons.  \n\nOn April 26, 2021, a DXdao contributor posted a DXVentures proposal for the DXdao community to signal the approval of a $100,000 grant investment to Opolis in exchange for $WORK tokens and a warrant for future $WORK tokens in the value of 0.33% of equity in Opolis in the event of a sale, merger, or dissolution of Opolis. After some discussion and a DXD Snapshot,  the DXdao community gave signal to go forward with an onchain proposal for a $100,000 grant investment to Opolis\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAgreement for Grant Investment from DXdao to Opolis, Inc. \n(“Grant Investment Agreement”)\n\nThe following states the terms of the Grant Investment Agreement between DXdao and Opolis. \n \t \t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nUpon execution of this onchain proposal DXdao (the “Grantor”) makes a grant investment to Opolis, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Grantee”), in the amount of $100,000.00 paid in xDai stablecoins (the “Grant Investment Amount”). \n\nThis Grant Investment Amount is approved as an unrestricted gift to Grantee in furtherance of its support of the Employment Commons, LCA (the “Commons”), which aligns economic incentives among members of the Commons in support of the future of the independent, self-sovereign worker (the “Grant Investment Agreement”). \n\nThe Grant Investment Amount is provided in exchange for: \n475,197 $WORK Rewards (“$WORK Token Allocation”), to be vested into Grantor’s xDai treasury contract address 0xe716EC63C5673B3a4732D22909b38d779fa47c3F (the “xDai Address”). 20% of the $WORK Token Allocation, in the amount of 95,040 $WORK, to vest immediately upon execution of this Grant Investment Agreement, with the remaining $WORK Token Allocation to completely vest over the course, and at the conclusion, of four (4) years from the date of the execution of this Grant Investment Agreement.  \n\nIn the event of sale, liquidation, and / or merger of Grantee, Grantor shall receive a number of $WORK tokens equalling 0.33% in equity of Grantee’s assets (“Future $WORK”). The value of 0.33% equity in Grantee shall be calculated at the time of sale, liquidation, or merger of Grantee. Upon sale, liquidation, or merger of Grantee, Future $WORK shall be sent to the xDai Address. \t\nIn the event that the xDai Address no longer functions as a DXdao-approved  contract address used to hold DXdao treasury funds, a separate onchain proposal must be made to a DXdao-Approved Onchain Voting Portal to determine the appropriate Ethereum contract address for which to send Future $WORK. \n\nA DXdao-Approved Voting Portal is defined as any onchain governance portal Grantor actively uses for its onchain decentralized governance voting that manages its onchain treasury. Currently, DXdao-Approved Voting Portals include DXdao Alchemy mainnet and xDAi bases located at the following addresses: https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a; and https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f. \n\n**Conditions**:\t\n\t\t\nGrantee warrants that the Grant Investment Amount will only be used for the purposes allowed by the IRS and other government agencies relating to grants from decentralized autonomous organizations.\t\t\t\t\t\nUpon reasonable request by Grantor, Grantee shall provide updates of the progress, and / or status of objectives including how the Grant Amount was expended to attain objectives.\t\t\t\t\t\nGrantor may be eligible for warrants exchangeable for Grantee common stock subject to certain conditions and the approval of Grantee’s Board of Directors and conditioned on Grantor’s provision of certain services as a strategic ally to Grantee.\t\t\t\nAny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to this Grant Investment Agreement, or the breach thereof, including the issue of arbitrability, shall be exclusively settled by Kleros decentralized arbitration service (“Kleros”), under Kleros arbitration rules. The number of arbitrators shall be based on the Kleros juror selection pool model. ","title":"Proposal for Grant Investment from DXdao to Opolis, Inc.

Using the old salary structure at level 5, the total pay for January would be `8000 / 22 * 5 = 1818.18 xDai`.

Data for USDM can now be visualized in the frontend.\n- Made it so the conversion from timestamps to block number sends API requests in parallel to the blocks subgraph on each network. This considerably reduces loading times across the table for charts.\n- Made it so that Pocket is now used for Gnosis Chain and mainnet, further decentralizing the product. As of now the Pocket RPC URL is only used for readonly calls as long as the user has no connected wallet. The idea is to make it so that every readonly call is always carried out using Pocket, even when a wallet is connected. The wallet-specific RPC URL should only be used while performing transactions.\n- Made it so that the numbers across the frontend are \"commified\", in order to improve legibility and UX slightly.\n- Added test KPI token campaigns for Mochi on Rinkeby.\n- Fixed network switching issues.\n- Moved a lot of logic-related stuff around platforms from the frontend to the SDK.\n\nProof for the claims above is available [here](https://github.com/carrot-kpi/frontend/commits/master?before=d247b22e819c928f4295277347929a38bd8dbf5e+35&author=luzzif).\n\nOn the SDK I have:\n\n- Added support for mainnet campaigns.\n- As mentioned above, ported over a lot of logic from the frontend (mainly related to platforms and data fetching).\n\nProof for the claims above is available [here](https://github.com/carrot-kpi/sdk/commits/master?before=73d465982116f462aefe0c39ae5eff66b25c4247+35&author=luzzif).\n\n### Jolt\n\nOn the contracts, I have mainly adjusted the cost evaluation function for work performed and started working on a new architecture overall.\nI've also started working on a frontend which got decently far into development, with the ability to monitor bonded JOLT, events emitted in the past 24hrs, add credit to jobs, show owned jobs and more.\n\nThe proof for these claims is not currently available due to the fact that the project's repos are still private. Once the product is released proof will be made available too.","title":"DAI payout (26/12/2021-25/01/2022) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmPvkVCSnpkcGdtjcqtuigPWXn9LkDRPHd5VgywJrEL4A2"},"0x982e4dcea86d80a72ea6da2dab6730e34b409bee35788b414ff032d265b03f9b":{"description":"The following provides details for reimbursement around ETHDenver Costs (including [ETHDenver Contributor Stipend](https://daotalk.org/t/ethdenver-contributor-stipend/3776))\n\nDaily stipend - $150/day, Feb 11-21 → $1,500\nused on groceries, meals, ubers, and DAODenver ticket\nTransportation → $400\nCovid testing → N/A\nAirbnb for 6 full time contributors + 2 guests → $8840.32\nDXdao Team Lunch (10 people) → $357.52\nDXdao Team Dinner (10 people) → $1181.17\n\nTotal → $12,275\n\nThis proposal is requesting 12,275 xDai in reimbursement.","title":"Level K - Reimbursements for ETHDenver Expenses","hash":"QmaXDpLcwacjQnTsTJdPHJinBFAz1F5r9zFzfxMfy838XR"},"0x9897941fba1f7450d3c038868485ac4ca23b83cc695eb9326f9394e6a6ded43f":{"description":"### Overview\nCurrently, DXdao has 1K ETH staked across multiple providers: 500 with Lido, 300 with StakeWise, and 200 with Rocket Pool. With another ~8.5k ETH still idle within the treasury, it is important for the DAO to consider investing these assets. Liquid ETH staking remains an optimal solution, providing ~4.5% returns with minimal risk vs other solutions, such as Aave, providing only ~0.4% APY.\n\nThere are early signs that the ETH staking network is getting congested, with validator queues reaching up to 3 weeks recently. As the demand for staking increases in the run-up to, and after the Merge, network congestion could increase further. It is an optimal time for DXdao to get ahead of the market and deploy further funds into ETH staking.\n\nWhilst diversifying across staking providers is important, this proposal will focus on adding further ETH only to the StakeWise pool. Lido’s TVL has grown significantly since the first staking proposal and there are growing concerns about their size and the amount of leveraged ETH staked within their pool. On the other hand, Rocket Pool are having issues scaling given their current infrastructure model, with their staking pool frequently closed to any new deposits.\n\nStakeWise has recently launched liquid staking on Gnosis chain and is currently the only liquid staking provider on the network. This provides DXdao with an opportunity to put further treasury assets to work in a liquid fashion.\n\nAs a reminder, StakeWise uses a dual token model - paying rewards in a separate token, rETH2 (rGNO), mapped to ETH (GNO) earned in the Beacon Chain. sETH2 (sGNO) represents the initial ETH (GNO) deposit into the staking pool and acts as an interest-bearing wrapped ETH (GNO). StakeWise has deep liquidity for both sETH2, rETH2 and sGNO, allowing DXdao to un-stake, with minimum slippage, should the need arise.\n\n|     | **Gnosis** |\n|:------------:|:------------:|\n|     **Token**    |     sGNO    |\n|      **APY**     |       17.5%   |\n|     **Fees **    |       10%    |\n| **Total Staked** |        ~40k    |\n\n### Proposal\nDeploy 255 GNO to StakeWise. DXdao will rely upon the Multi-Sig 0x9467dcFD4519287e3878C018c02f5670465a9003, which has already handled previous ETH staking proposals. Once the sGNO tokens are acquired, the MS shall return those funds to the mainnet DXdao treasury.\n\n### Acquiring the staked assets\nStake natively via the [StakeWise UI](https://app.stakewise.io/).\n\n### More info\n[Website](https://stakewise.io) / \n[Docs](https://docs.stakewise.io/)\n","title":"Stake 255 GNO - Signal Proposal","hash":"QmTLPCTi58PebFkJpAWyW1njsDifNDMPFLB8sPTMQyFsSX"},"0x98b2c1c74fcdfc72940f799218e6755f116ba4434cee06972c0033fa1305129f":{"description":"**Timeframe**\n\nTwo months, from April 11th, 2021 to June 11th, 2021.\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\nI will continue to focus on Omen development e.g. general bug fixes, upgrading wallet connect, supporting Kaden in implementing liquidity mining campaigns, and helping with anything else that may need my attention.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nCompensation is based on the Worker Compensation Guidelines at an experience level of 3.5.\n\n$13,000 total paid in DAI. 50% paid once the proposal has passed ($6,500) and the remaining 50% paid once the work agreement is complete.\n\n0.1667% REP paid once the proposal has passed and 0.1667% REP paid once the work agreement is complete.\n\n$9,000 in DXD paid to a vesting contract once the work agreement is complete.\n\nRelated forum post: https://daotalk.org/t/hexyls-worker-proposal-for-11-3-21-11-5-21/2856\n\n**Proof of work:**\n\nhttps://github.com/protofire/omen-exchange/commits?author=hexyls\n\nhttps://github.com/protofire/omen-exchange/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AHexyls\n\nhttps://github.com/hexyls\n","title":"Hexyls Worker Proposal for 11/3/21 - 11/5/21","hash":"QmTrPj4AMuaBGtHLVo42X6mFFNBVGKk1SZWxKj7QZNnURs"},"0x98db054c894540d00a413275f30c1b985c30ed15a5a3db26680bcbc98cba2e69":{"description":"**Background:**\n\nThis is my first contribution proposal.\nI’ve been working as a full stack developer for the past 4+ years in my full time job, with a main focus on Nodejs and React.\n\nI was introduced to Dxdao by Federico, then I started working on a few minor issues on the swapr site, and then I moved on to swapr-info and started digging into the project in order to add a new section for multi networks statistics.\n\nI’m not very familiar with web3 on a technical point of view, and also I don’t have much experience in DeFi and financial concepts but I’m interested in it and going to learn more about it.\n\n**Timeframe:**\n\n- trial 14/03/2022 – 01/04/2022\n- 2 months 01/04/2022 - 01/06/2022\n\n**Proposed Scope of Contribution:**\n\n**Goals:**\n\n- Dashboard page for swapr-info\n- Minor UI issues and bugs on swapr-dapp\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n- Fix the assigned minor issues on swapr-dapp\n- Build a first version of the new dashboard page for swapr-info, with stacked charts for liquidity and volume (for all current networks)\n- Add new features to the swapr-info dashboard\nCompensation:\n\nExperience Level: 2\n\nTime commitment: Part-time (10h/week)\n\n2 weeks trial:\n- $250 (xDAI)\n- $125 DXD vested for 3 years with a 1 year cliff starting the 14/03/2022\n\nMonth 1:\n- $800 (xDAI)\n- $400 DXD vested for 3 years with a 1 year cliff starting the 01/04/2022\n\nMonth 2:\n- $800 (xDAI)\n- $400 DXD vested for 3 years with a 1 year cliff starting the 01/04/2022\nI’ll receive the monthly salary at the end of each month.\n\n**Work Experience:**\n\nThis is my first contribution proposal so I don’t have any past work experience related to previous proposals at Dxdao, but I have worked on some issues on swapr, visible here:\nPRs: Pull requests · levelkdev/swapr-dapp · GitHub 2\n\nAlso I’m currently working as a full-stack developer (4+ years) in my full time job.

Since then, 7379.07 DXD have been purchased on mainnet and xDai for an [average price of 0.154 ETH/DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing). Using the USD price at the time of purchase, $3.7m of DXD has been purchased. This is just over 15% of the DXD circulating supply.\n\nThe [buyback program was updated](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153) in June to increase the slippage tolerance of trades as well as clarify the accounting measures. The[ buyback program was then extended](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x6f4bb1bb12469639b4af6f67ee04b174b07df211b3de45e6254de65082446af0) for another $1m in August, [then another $1m in September](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d) and again [in October for $1m.](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-extension-3-draft/3444) The total amount of DXD purchased is quickly approaching the limit placed on it by the previous proposal and soft community consensus has demonstrated support for another $1m extension.\n\nAccounting for the 7,379 DXD purchased and the 461 DXD that has been issued to contributors in vested contracts, the 458 DXD that has been issued to LPs for Swapr farming and the 1908 DXD in unissued DXD compensation (461.4) and to LPs for Swapr farming rewards (458.6), the outstanding DXD supply (45,145 DXD) represents a market cap of $38m - still comfortably below the $69.5m in ETH and stables in the DXdao treasury and the $11m in the buyback reserve. The buyback program is intended to address this discrepancy and acquire an undervalued asset.\n\nAs the DXD Buyback Program passes 7,000 DXD acquired, the Gov Ops squad has been looking for ways to streamline the process. This extension features two key changes. First, the mainnet signal proposal is also sending the funds necessary to complete the buyback, and as with the previous transfer, these are being sent directly to the GP relayer on xDai. Second, unlike previous proposals this proposal suggests the extension be done in an ETH amount, equivalent to the price of $1m at the time of writing this proposal. Hence, 215 ETH. Using ETH rather than USD in this extension allows for easier monitoring and execution of the buyback as the exact amount can simply be deposited into the GPv1 relayer on xDai. Tracking also becomes much easier as one has to simply check the funds in the GPv1 relayer. \n\n**Details**\n\nThis proposal extends the DXD Buyback Program for another $1m to $5m total under the same conditions outlined in the original [Buyback Program signal proposal](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8), [the parameter update](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153) and the [first extension](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x6f4bb1bb12469639b4af6f67ee04b174b07df211b3de45e6254de65082446af0), [second extension](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d) and the [third extension](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/mainnet/proposal/0xa637da9c7b3ec15cf1220bb90b94f181d335a3403f6f4b78e6c58874adf99fba).\n\nThis proposal also sends 215 ETH to the ETHrelayer contract, identified as, `0xb9C11a239CEb03626b439dDeD95AC51ffe000795`, which will relay the ETH to the dev multi-sig address, previously identified as `0x5f239a6671bc6d2baef6d7cd892296e678810882` whose signatories have been verified as REP holders, which will convert it to WETH and bridge it over to be deposited into the GPv1 relayer on xDai.\n\nThese and other DXD purchases through the Buyback Program have contributed to the community’s intention to use the buyback reserve to purchase DXD. ETH from [DXdao’s general treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) can be used in lieu of the buyback reserve until the DXD token contract is upgraded and that ETH is recovered. In total, the [buyback reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521) has 2,499 ETH and so far, 1142 ETH has been used to purchase 7,379 DXD through the buyback program.\n\n**Risks and considerations**\n\nThe program will take place on xDai, a sidechain with less security properties than Ethereum. The Buyback Program has been running for four months with few problems; the GP Relayer has worked to complete the purchases at the market price. There is a concern that Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai will have limited support, but DXdao community members are striving to maintain the network of solvers. The community is also exploring additional options\n\nDXdao has already spent over $3.7m repurchasing DXD. This has increased the price of DXD relative to ETH but it still falls below the book value of ETH in the treasury.\n\nFull execution of this proposal relies on the Dev multi-sig, which has already bridged and transferred millions of dollars of assets to xDai.","title":"DXD Buyback Extension #4 (Signal Proposal)","hash":"QmWKR59c9pe6KFNKgDSx9M1Q8orZQfvzwwPjWztuQWLEzE"},"0x9a76b2afd39dd2cded8454a7002d024aa573bbb4638bb57ec3370753759e8ef9":{"description":"**Please view the links and best formatting on my corresponding DaoTalk proposal: [https://daotalk.org/t/caden-rain-worker-proposal-5-17-2021-7-31-2021/2939](url)\n\nThis proposal is requesting the DAI and REP for the work done during my two-week trial period, which amounts to 0.0416% REP, or 651 REP, and 1500 xDAI.

I’ve been following DXdao for some time, and I have a lot of ideas for how I can contribute to the Marketing efforts here, specifically to Omen. I was formally introduced to the community by @JohnKelleher and have talked with @KeenanL about projects to work on during my trial period. I also discussed my contribution plan with the Marketing and Communications team as a whole on the most recent call.\n\nI’ve been a user of various online prediction markets, and I understand the pain points the online prediction markets community struggles with. Omen provides excellent relief from the problems associated with the most popular online prediction market, Predictlt. Omen has significantly lower fees, no betting limits, and is decentralized. But despite Omen’s numerous benefits, the platform suffers from few users and low liquidity. My primary focus will be on closing this communication gap and allowing Omen to realize the full potential of its underlying technology! In the next 2.5 months my goals are to start and execute on the following initiatives:\n\nAcquire users for Omen\nIncrease awareness of Omen within the online betting community\nProvide marketing and writing support for a variety of projects\nTime-frame:\n\nTrial Period: 17th May 2021 - 27th May 2021\n\n27th May 2021 - 31st July 2021 (contingent on the trial period)\n\nResponsibilities\n\nConduct marketing and build awareness for Omen across a variety of channels including online prediction markets-related Telegram chats, Discord servers, and the comments section on PredictIt\nWrite Tweets for DXdao and Omen\nAssist with a variety of projects where I can apply my marketing and writing expertise such as the DXdao rebranding, updating the copy on the DXdao landing page, and any other projects that may arise\nDeliverables\n\nMarketing page comparing the differences between PredictIt and Omen (this is a very favorable comparison for Omen)\nGuide to Omen for users who’ve bet on PredictIt or another online prediction market before, but are new to Omen\nGuide to Omen for users who are completely new to betting on prediction markets\nThe marketing page and guides I create will be essential for Omen to acquire additional users and realize the full potential of the platform. I will also use the comments section of PredictIt to inform PredictIt users about the low-fee alternative of Omen. This has been a highly successful strategy for Omen’s leading competitor Polymarket, it’s how I found out about Polymarket , and Omen would be wise to learn from this success. I’ll also conduct guerrilla marketing and awareness building across a variety of other channels including prediction-markets related Telegram chats, Discord servers, and more.\n\nCompensation\n\nLevel 3, Full Time\n\nTrial period (50%):\n\nBase Salary: $1500 DXD: $1000 REP: 0.0417%\n\nContingent on successful trial period, following two months (80%):\n\nBase Salary: $9600 (80% x $6000/month x 2 months), 50% to be paid at the beginning of the work period and 50% to be paid at the conclusion of the work period DXD: $6400 (80% x $4000/month x 2 months) REP: 0.2666%\n\nWorker Experience\n\nMy professional experience is in marketing and writing, and I have a Bachelors in Business Administration from Northeastern University.

I believe this is the highlight of my contributions so far. I have also invested some time in taking care of minor issues on down times while my PRs required reviews.\n\nTo improve: Although the COW protocol was a success, there were a couple of issues during its implementation leading us to scale down some features while having a functional product. While sorting out minor issues I still required quite some help from other developers and was not able to do these tasks by myself. This shows I still have a lot to learn.\n\nProposed Scope of Contribution:\n\nGoals:\n\n- Integrate COWswap\n- Add a new network to ecoRouter\n- Pick and fix 1/2 issues from the backlog\n- Further deepen knowledge in web3 ecosystem\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n- Collaboration with the existing Swapr team\n- Meetings: Pair Programming, Regular meeting\n- PR review and low-level design decision\n- Software development\n- Documentation Creation and Improvement\n\nPrevious coutributions:\n- [Contributor proposal for April/May 2022](https://daotalk.org/t/jorge-lopes-contributor-proposal-18-april-2022-18-may-2022/4036)\n- [Contributor proposal for May/June 2022](https://daotalk.org/t/jorge-lopes-contributor-proposal-18-may-2022-18-june-2022/4269)\n\nTimeframe:\n1 month\n\nCompensation:\nExperience Level: 4\n\nTime commitment: Full-time (40h/week)\n$6,000 (DAI) distributed monthly\n$4,000 (DXD) vested continuously after a one year cliff over the two following years\n0.1667% REP\n\nSpecifically for DXD the plan would be to transfer $1,333 after 1 year and 2,667$ vested continuously for the 2 years after, totalling a duration of 3 years.\n\nFor this proposal I shall add the reputation for both the previous and current month.","title":"Jorge Lopes Contributor Proposal [18 June 2022 - 18 July 2022]","hash":"QmYZCixH99yBgRYmcLgkcVJFNwXfJT4thiS1AZUcW5aFGt"},"0x9c43d086f4bd4c241a5d02d336fc01a6bdf14e5319baa8fa66afe03a3e8be207":{"description":"This proposal sends 12.13 WETH to the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions) intended to be used to place an order to purchase xDXD in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was originally passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45), and extended for another $1m to $3m total, through a further proposal which also passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x56c66f99d87a48d707475aa2466f0a58da13bd744475410957d6572b439cc5bf).

This would mean we have new versions of every part of the dxdao governance architecture, except for the voting machine.\n\nThe reason the split was made here is so that we can do a parallel deployment of DXdao using these new contracts and begin migrating over to them. This will allow us to focus on this new system and get comfortable with how it can operate and deliver many security fixes to make DXdao safer.\n\nThis would then also allow us to focus exclusively on the new voting machine logic when it is later upgraded.

This wouldn’t be a quarterly distribution, but rather a quarterly allocation; a way for us to leave the door open to those most active in the community to further involvement with DXdao and its governance.\n\n> In its current configuration, the DXdao Discord server tracks a user’s participation in the preceding quarter and assigns a role based on quantity and quality of the engagement. Since these roles are based on the previous 90 days, it makes lots of sense to distribute some REP this way. Users wouldn’t be able to participate at an early date, and collect REP regularly despite no recent contribution.\n\n> **Eligibility**\n\n> The below list contains all users eligible for a boost, their respective level, and the allocation of mainnet REP they are entitled to receive. Active DXdao contributors are not eligible for this initiative and have been removed from the list. Anyone nominated for a [traditional community REP boost](https://daotalk.org/t/community-rep-boosts-apr-2021/2850) 1 should still be eligible for this initiative, since high levels are difficult to obtain and the REP is distributed quarterly instead of monthly. This is, of course, up for discussion.\n\nA \"FOR\" vote indicates support of this program and would welcome the listed community members to request the REP amount shown on the post. \n\nAn \"AGAINST\" vote indicates opposition to this program and that it needs revision or cancellation.","title":"DXdao Discord REP boost signal proposal","hash":"QmUq1EqYmjF1s7SBLTuGwSvNdHJtK16xVPqPjxV3r2fopU"},"0x9e0a7e234816693088f67ee9c3f475563a19705a81f703d606b9b678c16cffc2":{"description":"Our devshop has supported the Swapr team with development ressources.

It was also nice receiving some good feedback on the format we handed it back to them in - [read here](https://rossneilson.notion.site/Sigma-Prime-Guilds-Audit-Fixes-145724bb627c4eab94cf285552f2c128). Obviously, this directly blocks the release of guilds since we don't have the report back yet.\n* **DXD guild -** Although the [post](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-voting-power-guilds-2-0/4467) only went up recently a lot of time was put into the article to bring the idea of a DXD guild to DXD holders. I’m hopeful this will provide a meaningful way for DXD holders to voice and enact their opinions in an autonomous way.\n* **Documentation/Planning -** Still really just a start but I ended up using [DXgov’s notion](https://rossneilson.notion.site/DXgov-c1655a56255b4ad78d05162c634b0634) a lot more this period with a total of 12 new posts covering documentation and planning. I still dont think many people read this but it is at least for me a better way of getting ideas onto paper and collecting them into one place. I did also advertise a few in general chats to get thoughts. In particular, I was very happy with some of the planning I got onto paper around [DAVI revenue](https://rossneilson.notion.site/Governance-Revenue-generation-a806c15aca364fd8a4fb2cf61ca75ba4)\n* **Budget -** I took quite a good amount of time looking at DXgov’s budget and I think the work done should help much better give an idea of where DXdao is investing resources. Coming out relatively small in comparison was nice to see and I think we are managing to do some pretty great work considering our budget. The forward-looking budget was made trying to be realistic but also limiting expansion due to market conditions.\n* **QA -** QA’s role in DXgov is growing and I cant really take much credit as it has been Phillip and Milan putting in the work but it is great to see the processes grow and I am sure having QA will greatly increase the quality of DAVI.\n* **DXgov team -** Although this isn't pointing to anything directly nor is it even something I can take all or anything near all the credit for, the team has been working SUPER well recently. We have been crushing each sprint, increasing story points completed, improving processes, devs working on smart contracts and getting very close to being able to show you all our hard work.\n* **Took a holiday! -** I think I have done a pretty good job handling work life balance and taking breaks recently and have been really happy with the results. I find myself more efficient with my time and very far from burnout.\n\n**Did ok:**\n\n* **DAVI’s place in DXgov and DXdao -** I think I am now at the point where I have a solid understanding of what DAVI is and what it can be. But the reason this is just ok is that everyone needs to understand this and right now I think everything DXgov is working on is still pretty confusing. I hope to fix this once we get branding of DAVI sorted, can put out more articles and get the app into people’s hands.\n\n* **Partnerships -** We got a connection to a couple of more teams interested in what we are building so continuing to build out those relationships and future integrations. In addition, followed up with some previous connections. Having DAVI live should help with demos and actually getting people on board.\n* **IPFS solutions -** I developed a small tool (https://github.com/DXgovernance/ipfs-cluster-propagator) for us to propagate our own IPFS data across DAO contributors. As an initial proof of concept, I think it is pretty awesome and a good way for us to utilise decentralised hardware to benefit the DAO. But it needs more people to use it, so still a work in progress. As a side note with the help of Federico and Madusha we have come up with a super awesome concept for a v2 :eyes:\n* **DXdao 1.5 -** We are making big progress towards the contracts being ready for a new parallel DXdao deployment but I didn’t get to spend as much time as I wanted planning out how we are going to handle things on the DAVI side. With how timelines are now I think it is likely we will go with a simple subgraph and tackle the backup cache architecture later.\n\n**Could have done better:**\n\n* **Writing -** I had a bunch of help on the DXD guild article and I am so grateful for that. But I also really want to work more on my own writing style and improve on how I go about polishing the pieces. I think I tend to write in a very personal style and I dont think it works for more structured pieces like this.\nTimeframe: 2 months\n\n**Compensation: Level 6**\n\n**Salary -**\n\nI will be receiving my funds via DevX AG and as such proposals will transfer stablecoins to an address other than my own.\n\nThe last three proposals I made I did not transfer any stablecoins with because I was waiting for DevX AG to be approved [on chain](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/mainnet/proposal/0xbb4921904e4d7d787b61be32ef798ca3365a3d74fcef471ee8d4450352d6f333)\nBecause I cannot send payments to one address and rep to another using the ContributionReward scheme I will request REP only on my worker proposals and then create another proposal dealing with stablecoins being sent to the DevX AG address.\n\n**1st month -**\n\n$8000 DAI\n\n$6000 DXD\n\n0.1667% REP\n\n**2nd month:**\n\n$8000 DAI\n\n$6000 DXD\n\n0.1667% REP","title":"Ross Neilson Worker Proposal 18/8/2022-18/10/2022 1/2","hash":"QmUA5A9Qktf76bBNd3ZkjvrcDTzE8aCCyD2TkVmrp1AaHb"},"0x9f5256a548e04595d5d7a592394a978591393534aa563fc4aa8438b48add8e5b":{"description":"Haven't the slightest clue where the time has gone.

I’ve also made headway with the Omen video, which is almost completed. There has also been progress in getting DXdao more involved in legal advocacy efforts for DAOs and DeFi.\n\nDid Okay: I think at this point most contributor questions regarding legal entity formation has been addressed, but this is such a complex area that I’ve never been satisfied with the open-ended status on how contributors will be paid in certain jurisdictions. I think this is something that needs to be continually worked on and thought about, and is not entirely resolved.\n\nNeeds Improvement: I’m late on this proposal along with other budget request proposals.

I worked on a part-time basis during these days and so will subtract 2 days of pay from my second payment request ($800 Dai and $600 DXD):\n\n$15,200 (DAI) $8,000 to be paid once the proposal gets approved and the remaining $7200 on or after 9/12/2021 when the work contract finishes.\n\n$11,400 (DXD). $5,400 (DXD) vested at 1 year, and continued vesting after the first year on a linear schedule.\n\n0.3334% REP\n\n**Additional Requests for Reimbursement:**\n\nETHCC Travel and Stay Stipend: $1250 DAI\n\nReimbursement for the cost of 3 months of the Bloomberg Law Subscription (legal research tool) : $1738 DAI\n\nI presented obtaining this subscription a couple months back during a governance call. I use this to research topics on legal questions for DXdao. I’ve found it helpful to have the most accurate and up-to-date information on fintech legal issues, as well as see what other projects have been doing for legal frameworks.\n\nI joined DXdao as a part-time contributor as of 12/12/20.

Full-time with 40 workable days/2 months\n\n**Position:** DXvoice coordinator, Community Leader, Internal Operations and Documentation\n\n**Background:** **This is the previous period's context:** This proposal comes a bit late, but hopefully gives a unique _in-progress_ look at this contribution window. \n\nSo far in this period, notable accomplishments include:\n\n- [Participating in an interview with DefiSlate](https://twitter.com/KeenanLukeCCC/status/1485712306147258368)\n- Executing SWPR token accounting and multi-sig campaign deployments\n- [Executing Discord REP boosts for Q4](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-discord-rep-boosts-q4-2021/3778)\n-  Discord restructure and role information sheet\n- Guiding [record breaking 1Hive TV Trivia Episode](https://twitter.com/1HiveOrg/status/1483454141032718336)\n- Assisting in preparation for ETHdenver swag and strategy\n- Preparing the [2021 DXvoice Recap including future outlook](https://daotalk.org/t/dxvoice-2021-recap-and-outlook/3807)\n- Guiding and facilitating DXvoice recruitment\n\nDespite still being relatively early, there is lots to be done! Most notably of which including ETHdenver, which we are continuing to prepare for. \n\n## Reflection :\n\n### In reflection of this proposal, [January - February](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-contributor-proposal-for-01-2022-to-03-2022/3832), what I think I did well includes:\n\n- **Community and Brand** - This period more-so than ever before included branching DXdao into the wider ecosystem. This was accomplished through [interviews](https://twitter.com/KeenanLukeCCC/status/1485712306147258368), [fun trivia games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMNNm65P4IA), impressive ETHdenver merch, and much more. The network effects are becoming apparent, with more and more active crypto participants becoming familiar with DXdao and its vision.\n\n- **Landing pages/DXdocs** - Both the DXdao and Swapr landing pages are now live to high initial praise. The Swapr landing page is notable since its an experiment in combining a traditional landing page dapp separation. DXdocs v1.1.0 also released, and although it still needs lots of work, DXdao's information resource got much, much deeper.\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **DXdao Selling/Focal** - I shed some light on this in my ETHdenver outlook post. I think I should focus more time on solidifying what this focal point is, and how we can continue to capitalize on this through objective and monitorable KPI's. More context: https://daotalk.org/t/keenans-ethdenver-thoughts-and-personal-outlook/3933#dxdao-needs-to-discuss-and-clarify-its-focal-selling-point-5\n\n- **Swapr farming organization** - Coordination of the previous SWPR farming epoch became very difficult when considering creation of Carrot campaigns and contentious opinions on use of GNO rewards. Going forward, I'd like to ensure that these campaigns are both live in the UI at least a week before, and created through DXdao governance on Gnosis Chain rather than the multi-chain multi-sig where possible. \n\n## Compensation:\n\nThis proposal reflects my translation to the updated contributor guidelines. After discussion with relevant contributors and considering my reviews from the new review program, I will be posting this proposal at level 7. My responsibility pool including leadership tasks, to me, fairly put me within the bounds of level 7. Although personally, I would consider myself freshly within this level, and I believe I still have lots of room for personal growth and time before considering any further adjustments. This comes on the tail end of 0xKLOM.eth transitioning to level 5 on the original compensation guidelines. \n\n* Experience Level: 7\n* Full-time.\n* Month one.\n  * $9,000 (xDai) + $81 (xDai).\n  * $7,500 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n  * 0.1667% REP.\n* Month two.\n  * $9,000 (xDai) + $81 (xDai).\n  * $7,500 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n  * 0.1667% REP.\n\n$81 accounts for the previously specified $36 monthly community tool costs (statbot, yagpdb, etc…), as well as $45 monthly expenditure of Discord boosts to attain level 2 (Better audio quality, banner, community server status, etc). Although these community costs are still small, I would like to transition these to either their own proposal or the multi-sig as the costs grow - bonus benefit of deeper accountability and a trail that can be followed if I were to disappear. \n\nThis proposal will request Month two’s xDai, and 0.3334% mainnet REP on GC. This proposal will also specify an owed 0.3334% of mainnet REP, and owed $15,000 DXD based on average price over the final month on Swapr provided it is above $523, otherwise $523 will be used. This will be determined at a later date.","title":"0xKLOM.eth Contributor Proposal for 01/2022 to 03/2022 2/2","hash":"QmTm5QjRpbsYFYcWpxi7L8yF7Pe4mFy41EGLjDy81DCmVT"},"0xa7ae51e589abdda68f082f0ea3f1f51e8be0fa04fd1c75a5f45c855f5cfe97d5":{"description":"This proposal launches a SWPR / XDAI farming campaign that starts Thu Mar 17th 2022 at 15:00 and ends Thu Apr 14th 2022 at 15:00; distributing 42,000 SWPR tokens and 42,000 \"SWPR Swapr GC TVL 04-14\" Carrot tokens over that time period.\n\nREP holders approved the SWPR token and farming campaigns through a [signal proposal that passed in August of 20221](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x2d00135332c28271ba27c6f02f9aa79a480b4d7c58df37fb30e6a55353470910).

I personally feel that it was a good period of great productivity, where I advanced in the knowledge of important pieces of our governance system. The last period review is available here 1 where I go more in-depth.\n\n### Goals:\n\n- Continue to work on Guilds development acording to the dxgov roadmap.\n- Continue testing the dapp, finding and creating new issues to add to our backlog.\n- Work on any new issue in the contracts repo and participate in the next release of the dxdao contracts.\n- Try to join forces with the QA team, in case they need it. Otherwise, I consider that Guilds is on a “stable” point considering some of the main features, so I will try to advance a little in the integration tests on the parts we know are not going to change.\n\n### Responsibilities:\n- Collaborate with Dxvote squad to improve the app and team processes.\n- Spend a good amount of time doing code reviews for Davi, dxvote, and dxdao-contracts.\n- Being an active member of the squad, participating in meetings/discussions, being available to my teammates in any circumstance they need me.\n\n### Timeframe:\n2 months.

Close to the last weeks there was a great demo of DAVI’s progress. It is very encouraging for me to see how everything that we have been working on is taking shape and how close we are of having a productive/stable version. Many interesting things happened in the dao, and with that consideration the importance of communicating our progress is evident. Even though some of the things that happened were a bit discouraging, it felt great to invest more time on dao matters, being informed and voting more actively.\n\n#### Went well:\n- DxAvatar contract refactor: Even though it was relatively simple, I think that the whole team worked very well on daostack contracts refactor. Excellent effort and organization from @AugustoL for preparing, assigning the tasks and supporting/mentoring in the process.\n- Governance/Coding balance: As I mentioned before, during this period I spent more time on dao matters. I can’t be precise about the time, but it was enough to be informed of the latest proposals and comments, vote on some of them and attend the relevant meetings. Despite this I think my productivity remained as usual, which is good. This is something I definitely want to continue doing and improving, for sure.\n- Code reviews: I think my organization was much better than previous months. As a result, I have been able to spend more time reviewing code as well.\n- We have made a lot of progress at DAVI and I feel very good about my contributions this period. No crazy/hight-impact feature (maybe) but a lot done. Details below.\n#### Did ok:\nAlthough QA team took integration tests responsibility I don’t feel like I was able to help too much. I did helped with their prs and was able to join qa meetings but I think I can have a little more initiative to reach out to help them move forward. Nevertheless I think we are just taking good steps into structuring qa and development teams workflow.\n#### I can improve on:\nI feel like I could have contributed more to the team. Perhaps for personal reasons, I was not able to came up with many new ideas or help the team members much. My main contribution was the code, and it’s not bad but it can give much more as a team member.\n\n#### Closed PRs:\n[#210 - DxAvatar contract refactor](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/210)   \n[#149 - Add Validations to Actionsbuilder ERC20Transfer Editor](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/149)    \n[#160 - Add Validations to Actionsbuilder RepMint Editor](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/160)  \n[#169 - Display correct vesting contract params info](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/169)  \n[#174 - Fix approval calls](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/174)  \n[#178 - Add Validations to Actionsbuilder SetPermissions Editor](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/178)  \n[#199 - permissionRegistry updates](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/199)  \n[#222 - Fix permissionRegistry \"to\" field](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/222)  \n[#230 - Fix encode & decode values for approval calls](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/230)  \n[#237 - DAVI Refactor | Folder cleanup](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/237)  \n[#245 - Fix proposals filter](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/245)  \n[#256 - Add SWPR token transfer permissions in localhost](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/256)  \n[#267 - Add summary for spending calls](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/267)  \n[#275 - Display nice looking params for generic calls](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/275)  \n[#285 - Fix ActionsBuilder calls per option](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/285)  \n[#292 - Display Voted Option in proposal page](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/292)  \n[#307 - Add Davi Footer](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/307)  \n[#312 - Display wining option](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/312)  ","title":" Milton Contributor Proposal [25/07/2022 - 18/09/2022]","hash":"QmTzdh9tQk5tHKMCRoTEWuC4R3MrJ38uVfxSy3FX4ciznb"},"0xa887b5ff4ba31df94bd4790499fe700751f787b1181c90b7f7edf1351481957f":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal sends 8.82 WETH to the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions) intended to be used to place an order to purchase xDXD in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was originally passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45), and extended for another $1m to $3m total, through a further proposal which also passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x56c66f99d87a48d707475aa2466f0a58da13bd744475410957d6572b439cc5bf).

[According to the most recent on-chain data and estimates](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmU1gB6iJbEgxK2BF9ugmH4LSzmwqSA934jb8Y3aieTwtk), DXD has averaged $146k over the last 3 months, so this proposal sends 10.37 WETH to the GP relayer on xDai, identified as `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`, using a [$3520.25 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum). Further explanation of the [GP relayer can be found here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmd8TCEr6syKxAnmuBH3hsyvxfSgRJgANLTTorp3JGZY77). \n\nThis proposal falls under the DXD Buyback Program, because the value of the DXD circulating supply is less than the value in the ETH in DXdao’s treasury, [according to Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dxdao) and [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521).\n\nThis proposal sends funds to the GP Relayer.

I believe I help add to this, and not otherwise.\n\nAs much as we try to reach our goals through internal effort, we also acknowledge the need to make it easier for the members of the wider community to reach out to us with innovative ideas for collaboration. Sky suggested we needed a clear structure guiding people through the process of engaging with our community. It was a pleasure for me to write it up. It is currently on our forum, and with the help of Keenan we will soon have it featured within the documentation book. This should help with incoming interest, on top of our outbound reach to interested projects and communities.\n\nHaving to deal with a diverse group of people from all teams gives us the DXbiz members a unique vantage point, which I believe does not go unnoticed, and could even be appreciated as a common good ;P. To some extent we have a chance to serve as the glue between teams and help each team feel closer to others and up to date with all that is happening on a big picture level, aside from the daily calls. Again, I tend believe I do add to this, and not otherwise.\n\nI will be posting my proposal on Alchemy at the end of the week.\n\nTimeframe:\n\n2 months, 27th May - 22nd July, 2021\nCompensation:\n\nLevel 1\nCommitment: 100% full-time, 40h+/week\nMonthly DXD: $2000-worth at all time high, vested over 2 years with a 1-year cliff, starting 3/16/21\nMonthly REP: 0.1667%\nMonthly base: $4k in xDai\nHalf is to be paid on passing the Alchemy request matched to this proposal, with the remainer due after passing a subsequent Alchemy request to be matched with a follow-up end-of-period reflection post.\n\nBackground:\n[Intro - at trial;](https://daotalk.org/t/bizdev-worker-proposal-03-16-21-03-30-21/2772)\n[1st worker proposal - at start of period;](https://daotalk.org/t/nathan-worker-proposal-3-16-21-5-26-21/2797)\n[1st worker proposal - at end of period;](https://daotalk.org/t/nathans-worker-proposal-3-16-21-5-26-21-updated/2943)","title":"Nathan, contributor proposal #2, 5/27/21 - 7/22/21 (start)","hash":"QmfDz3JQEj6ZxosDQAkPCfCKjQ9gsDFZb29cmd7Xky1oxi"},"0xac69e782f2eee6e7645fc546e7f2d437b24d76c5be9578f3702ef8ecccf6bcc3":{"description":"This operation is to help xDXdao get out of debt.  \n\nThis proposal asks for reimbursement for the cost of GEN in DAI and also the associated ETH gas costs.  \n\n**Three mainnet txns:**\n\nTxn #1 \n\nMove DAI to mainnet and Claim it: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x353d8910667d0ad6b1a876dad6e2b73f73a88ea04293ae697defa70fa8114250\nGas: 0.018446699340283164 ETH\n\nIf you are wondering how ot use the xDai Bridge with out the UI, try this out! \n[How to use the xDai Bridge without the UI  ](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/xdai-bridge/using-the-xdai-bridge/how-to-use-xdai-bridge-without-ui )\n\nTxn #2\n\nSwapr DAI to GEN: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6b706058ef7203e71dacc25e12fb05158f9f918bafc337c84c2c98166a034a49\nGas: 0.03795801456538963 ETH\n\nTxn #3 \n\nSend GEN across DaoStack xGEN bridge: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb4eb192d70bdcc457942c3d426272ebccdc8dc125effbf9239de933150c4812e\nGas: 0.021540580812553536 ETH\n\nTotal ETH Gas: 0.077945295\n\n\nPurchase of GEN: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6b706058ef7203e71dacc25e12fb05158f9f918bafc337c84c2c98166a034a49\n\nDAI cost of GEN: 2,724.39 DAI\n\n**Proposal Summary:**\n\nMember Balancer Reimbursement of WETH 0.077945295 and xDAI 2,724.39\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"Member Balancer to Supply xDXdao with xGEN for Continued Operations","hash":"QmSPq1d1NxqW6oa4NiyJE6ro8gS9Jd2hMzhhyEmpZ1tj7e"},"0xac880ee754c5e6ca9f96e4c3733efc3ebb7257411fa99af01a4757936abee506":{"description":"Hi, This is Lee ChienHui.

Thank you for improvements and great proposals. Work on automation is not fast enough ‘cause we have a lot of PR’s that need to be tested, I think that’s priority so far because of preparation for launch to PROD. First step for improvement is to have a Smoke test ready in the pipeline which will be triggered on every merge to develop branch. Work a lot on Regression testing on release branches and communicate using a clear issue list.\n\nSpent a great time in Bogota and nice to meet you all !!!\n\n  - Successful constant testing and retesting of PRs. I tried to describe the bugs or strange behavior as well as possible so that the devs could understand and find solution to improve the state\n  - Improving FTC (Test Scenarios, Test Cases and HappyPath) so that they can be ready for automation tests but also for onboarding new members who would pass the manual testing according to the instructions from these documents and get to know better all the possibilities and features of Guilds\n  - Retrospective of the QA work done so far in order to look back on what has been done and consider how we can improve the work done so far and improve the work process even more\n  - Start with automation and working still on LOCAL, plan to push when Smoke test will be ready for the first stage\n\nImproved my understanding of Guilds and changed my approach in some specific cases. Need to work more on application knowledge and going deeply with it.\n\nI understand the values ​​of being a member of a DXdao and remaining self-motivated, disciplined, and consistent in my work. Working at DXdao makes contributors not only better in the technical field or DeFi experts, but also better people who work on themselves in every field and “fight” with themselves to achieve the same goal of decentralization. \n\n**Improvements:**\n\nI was focused on contributing to Guilds as soon as possible and “serving a purpose” as a QA Engineer as much as I can for this trial period I haven’t had that much time to learn and get to know more about DXdao in general and other projects mentioned in the weekly meetings, so my goal is to improve to benefit the community and beyond the Guilds project but to continue to contribute to Guilds as needed and more.\nMore focus on application knowledge, attend more meetings and discussions, work more on QA framework after completion of testing PR’s, better understanding of low level application and communication with smart contracts.\n\n**Proof of work:**\n\n#233 -

See the [original post Worker proposal](https://daotalk.org/t/draft-worker-proposal-adam-azad-q1-2021/2659)\n\nThis proposal requests a Worker Payment for February 2021.\n\n# Reflection on Contributor Experience\n\nI started my February excited to work on Mesa even though the team was just me, Martin, and Nico. There was a lot of work to be done, and my work, I mean organization, recruiting, and coding. I enjoyed interviewing some of the candidates such as Hamza, who eventually joined us. We had a few failed onboards as well; one developer ghosted us, another called told us we lack \"professionalism\" at Mesa and DXdao. Overall, February was a good month.\n\n### OKRs \n\nMy OKRs kind of drifted away from delivering and I take responsibility for that for the reason mentioned herein. One major struggle was the Dutch Auction mechanism implemented by the smart contract. I admit it took me 3 full days to wrap my head around how it works. And sometimes I question my knowledge of it. Anyhow, one focus we discussed with the PM was how to visually explain what is going during an auction. One objective was to [find a library](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/issues/12) to visually showcase this. There were a few attempts on my end, but eventually, Lee implemented a version of it - kudos to him. \n\nOn the subgraph side, I struggled with how it works and how to configure it - Nico once said their documentation isn't really helpful. Anyway, I am now the Jedi of the subgraph - and I managed to release the first version, even though it won't be used, but it has the foundations for v2.\n\n### Extra\n\nOne thing everyone has to appreciate at DXdao is remote-first culture. I do know if some of you have noticed, but I traveled to Amman for a week and was working from my Airbnb there. One night from a cafe in the heart of Amman. That I enjoyed. However, one thing I hated is me missing two scrum standups because I was in the sky at then.\n\n# Background\n\nMy name is Adam. A Full Stack Engineer with 4 years of experience. I have worked remotely with studios from Canada, Europe, and SE Asia.\n\nMy involvement in crypto goes back to 2012 when I accumulated my first Bitcoin through a platform, named CoinUrl, that paid for placing ads on the website in Bitcoin. I used CoinUrl on my first online startup. In mid-2017, I started mining Ethereum with one AMD RX 480 at my university. I then scaled it to a fleet of 19 GPUs.\n\nI also am active in DeFi as an investor and builder and getting my hands dirty with Solidity. 😊\n\nI bring experience from my software development and passion for working in the DeFi and blockchain space. It is my secret ingredient (don't tell others my secret )\n\nYou will find my past work/projects at [https://adamazad.com/work](https://adamazad.com/work) and [https://github.com/adamazad](https://github.com/adamazad). I am also working on [Kryptobase](https://kryptoba.se/) which is a mobile app to buy crypto in Iraqi Kurdistan. We plan to use an AMM (supposedly Uniswap or Swapr) under the hood and submit orders on behalf of our users.\n\n# Resume\n\nAn up-to-date version is available at [https://adamazad.com/resume](https://adamazad.com/resume) \n\n# Febraury Objectives\n\nThere is a Mesa prototype now, we will continue working on extending the functionality of the interface. I will be more scattered between the frontend interface, trying to create developer documentation. However, my main task is still implementing the design from Bertie's. \n\n### Mesa Interface\n\nAs we had two new additions to the FE team - Hamza and Lee, my focus shifted away from mainly \n\n- [PRs against the `main` branch](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aadamazad+is%3Aclosed)\n\n\n### Mesa Subgraph\n\nThe subgraph is a critical component of the Mesa dApp, and as such I will work on the v1 version of it. This version utilizes the base version of Gnosis's fork. \n\n- [Commits for v1 against `main`](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-subgraph/commits?author=adamazad)<sup>[1]</sup> \n- [`dev` branch](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-subgraph/tree/dev)\n\n<sub>[1] This link might be invalidated as I will merge v2 into main soon in one giant PR soon.</sub>\n\n### Trial period, 2 weeks\n\n**Start date:** Jan 13th, 2021\n\n**End date:** Jan 27th, 2021 \n\n**Total:** 14 days.\n\n**Hours:** 40/week\n\n# Timeframe\n\n**Start date:** Jan 28th, 2021\n\n**End date:** Feb 28th, 2021 \n\n**Total:** 1 month\n\n**Hours:** 40/week.\n\n## Compensation\n\n### One month pay, 80% rate\n\n- Level 3\n\n- Full-time: 40 hours/week\n\n- DAI: $4,800 (80% of $6,000)\n\n- DXD: $3,200 (80% of $4,000):\n\n    - $1,600 (DXD) vested after a 1-year cliff, and\n\n    - the remaining $1,600 (DXD) after the first year on a linear schedule.\n- REP: 0.13336% (80% of 0.1667%)","title":"Worker Proposal - Adam Azad - February 2021","hash":"QmRZc4nK6xQKoZ6XJvvhGiZuC9Zpo37z37oTk74ndbr2XU"},"0xae6535da6ee8bb0429258130b484bdef7392566a7bad7cbb6b321d292052b6d8":{"description":"This proposals sends a withdrawal request to the [GPv1 Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xe716EC63C5673B3a4732D22909b38d779fa47c3F/transactions) which initiates a withdrawal of 3300 DXD from the GPv1 Batch Exchange.\n\nThis proposal has to be executed before the actual withdrawal - which will be submitted as a second proposal.","title":"3300 xDXD Withdrawl Request from GPv1 Relayer","hash":"QmSHRN2ZHgVPDRVtVQmKwbdgQpv4hyiehqV2qkDQESBMMd"},"0xae9b1e2b0fe5b1b2e5fb169e1cb17bdeac9f44a72e684050c81a5aa00076cd29":{"description":"This proposal launches a AGVE/XDAI farming campaign that starts October 14 15:00 UTC and ends October 28 15:00 UTC and distributes 11,200 SWPR tokens over that time period.\n\nREP holders approved the SWPR token and farming campaigns through a[ signal proposal that passed in August](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x2d00135332c28271ba27c6f02f9aa79a480b4d7c58df37fb30e6a55353470910).

Caney Fork’s upcoming worker proposal can be found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-june-july-2022/4290).\n\nWhat I did well:\n\n* Passed the [DXD Buyback Program Adjustments, Extension #8 and Transfer of 373 ETH](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x69a881265303706f921c9c1ad25de4b0635ff288893455b34f18cdaf9e7f86de) proposal. This proposal gave clarity on outstanding questions for the DXD Buyback program, specifically on the DXD that has been repurchased and further commitment to the future. I wrote the proposal and engaged with different parts of DXdao community to find consensus.\n* Gave a presentation on [DAO Sovereignty at the Global Governance Gathering in Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvvt6aIGiLw&t=4s) that highlighted how DXdao is sovereign over its front-ends as well as the buyback orders. Also helped write the [April](https://medium.com/dxdao/dxdao-month-in-review-april-2022-d8804f0adfb2) and [May](https://dxdao.medium.com/dxdao-month-in-review-may-2022-fbaa16727941) month in review.\n* Began system to label proposals for better [forum management and organization](https://daotalk.org/t/forum-management-and-organization/4208)\n\nWhat I did okay\n\n* [DXdao Expenses Update June 2022](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-expenses-update-june-2022/4285) gives an overview of DXdao expenses over the last 18 months. I put ‘okay’ bc it took two weeks longer than the goal, but I think this is important for DXdao. It takes a lot of work to organize this, but I am finally feeling that it has a more scalable structure. We need to continue to work on the data input, so it’s not as manual.\n* DXD Trade [volume updates](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-biweekly-trade-volume-may-9/4163) - [these](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-biweekly-trade-volume-update/4092) were not ‘biweekly’ as promised, but still are necessary for buyback to continue. Like expenses, I now have a scalable system with less manual work.\n* DXD vesting for contributors & REP syncs - along with Ally and Melanie, helped several contributors do important proposals to sync REP and claiming their vested DXD.\n* DAO Counsel - this process has taken longer than expected (interviewing people takes a long time!), but it has also changed what I think DXdao needs. There are a couple candidates that we’ve interviewed that could fit well in DXdao and perhaps more in a specialist way.\n\nWhat I did not do well at:\n\n* Still late on this proposal, but at least I’m consistently about 20 days late, so it’s almost like it’s every two months :-x\n* There has not been progress on the DXD token working group front or the DXdao ENS governance platform. The expenses and daily operational responsibilities crowded out any time to work on these items. I should have time to work on these in July.\n\nAs a general thought, I’ve felt a little burnt out the last month or so. In part because my family and I are in the process of moving and partly because it’s been a long two years in crypto (the bear before was not fun either, but it wasn’t as tiring). I’m looking forward to some time off and also a reset in Nashville and the summer.\n\nPayment and Logistics:\n\nMay payment:\n\n* Stables: $8,100 (90% at Level 8)\n* $8,550 in DXD, using 30 day average for DXD price, vested for 3 years with one year cliff\n* No REP as Caney Fork as reached 4% max on mainnet","title":"Caney Fork Worker Proposal Apr/May 2022 [2/2]","hash":"QmbVA9g9xRn4gdQ6wpphhy5HesXedHB2uLeQhcABLUgoFr"},"0xaf6c9e6fb5c3f5362c5420714a6cc4402ac3cd7149b2b90163a4434ff09d6492":{"description":"This proposal sends 14.4 WETH to the [GP Relayer ](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions)intended to be used to place an order to purchase xDXD in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45).

This proposal was planned to end on 7/1/2023 but I will end it on 31/12/2022 so I can have a fresh start on my next proposal on DAVI guilds from 1/1/2023. Here are some highlights from this period:\n\n#### CARROT\nIt was a very active couple of months for Carrot on both discussions and development progress. Happy that we are gradually moving some of the tasks to GitHub, here are some examples:\n\nhttps://github.com/carrot-kpi/v1-monorepo/issues/22\n\nhttps://github.com/carrot-kpi/v1-monorepo/issues/23\n\nA link to the Figma file https://www.figma.com/file/XEtWg0Op1SVVCbtonTDGF0/Carrot-Dapp-v1?node-id=3%3A26&t=ROWiqogc4NE5o6my-1\n\n#### DAVI\nThanks to regular calls with @ross my onboarding into project DAVI went very smoothly. I get all the examples and information I need to understand and execute my tasks on time. The tasks that were marked as a priority was done:\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/issues/417\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/davi-monorepo/issues/18\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/davi-monorepo/issues/9\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/davi-monorepo/issues/8\n#### VOICE\nLately, I’ve been focusing on mostly UI-related work, so it feels nice to get back to some graphic design stuff. Made some banners and a POAP template for Swapr and DXdao community calls.\nWhat went well:\n\n- Carrot tasks are getting more structured and easier to follow\n- DAVI onboarding\n- Closer work with the development teams\n\nWhat could be improved:\n\n- Add more structure to tasks and files\n- Communication\n- UX skills\n- Self-organization\n\n#### Compensation:\n\nI used my free days off on November 23 and December 22. The second part of my proposal (Dec 7 - Jan 7) has 23 working days. I took holidays on December 29-30 and January 2-3, and will deduct them as a part of this proposal. Since I’m ending my proposal early on Dec 31, I need to take away 5 working days plus 4 days off = 9 days.\n\nThe calculations were tricky, but thanks to @allyq we got the correct numbers right here:\n\n23 - 9 days = 14 working days\n\n6000 / 23 = 260.8695$ DAI per day\n4000 / 23 = 173.9130$ DXD per day\n0.1667 / 23 = 0.00724783 REP per day\n\nFor the second half of the proposal i will request:\n\n- 14 x 280.8695 = **3,932.17$** in DAI\n- 14 x 173.9130 = **2,434.78$** in DXD\n- 14 x 0.00724783 = **0.10146962** REP\n","title":"Borisblock — Contributor Proposal [07/11/22 - 07/01/23] 2/2","hash":"QmavQmhvUpcSh6FE6Yu1EtQYco2CZ2XVQtYqNuxtBdARDK"},"0xb1788662f6a57ea4228b668098286891657f1470916a83aaec981f33dee308a2":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

I have a lot of planning to do and ideas to share with the community regarding the future of DXvote.\n\nI cannot reflect all my work on the current proposal but I was very active during the past month and helping everyone in the dxdao team that needed help, I showed a lot of the work I was doing in the developer call, that is where I have to show myself and prove my work to the community, also did a demo of dxvote in last week weekly call in discord, so I guess it is clear that I have been working a lot, if someone thinks otherwise let me know in the comments.\n\nThis is my third contribution proposal and I feel way more conformable than the worker proposals I had in the past, I feel more free to work on things I want to and seems like the things I want to work are the ones that DXdao needs, which is great.\n\n## Compensation\n\nExperience Level: 5\n\n- DAI : 16000 USD payed in DAI.To be payed in DXvote on xdai or arbitrum network.\n- DXD: 12000 USD vested for 2 years with a 1 year cliff starting the 01/08/2021.\n- REP: 0.16% at based on latest REP supply on mainnet at the moment of submitting the worker payment.\n\n\n## Work Validation\n\nAll or most of this goals should be accomplished.\n\n- DXvote needs to be working in Production, staging and development environments in a secure way.\n- DXvote should have had contributions from more developers, a good goal would be to have two more solid contributors.\n- DXvote was communicated in the Blockchain Lisbon Week in October.\n- The payment of this proposal can be done using Arbitrum network, with proposal templates, deploying DXD and issuing NFT for worker validation using WalletSchemes.\n- DXvote is entirely owned and managed by DXdao.\n\n## Work Experience\n\n* 6 years as full-stack web developer, 4 years working with blockchain stuff - [augustol.eth ](https://augustol.eth.link/)\n* [Contribution Proposal #2](https://daotalk.org/t/augustol-contribution-work-proposal-2/3044)\n* [Contribution Proposal #1](https://daotalk.org/t/augustol-contribution-work-proposal-1/2865)\n* [Contribution Work 3/2021 ](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x880e03d957f3ccc31d0cd307a424b11a015cfda9b9fce4ee329ca121a1a3e76d)\n* [Worker Proposal 1/2021 - 2/2021 ](https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-for-11-20-to-12-20-github-augustol)\n* [Worker Proposal 11/2020 - 12/2020 ](https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-for-11-20-to-12-20-github-augustol)\n* [Worker Proposal 09/2020 - 10/2020 ](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x35ea176732d1b0270782bd98ba277ff063771ead53efe0d17f3cb172f4138294)\n* [Worker Proposal 07/2020 - 08-2020 ](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x21dc2eba5e197170dce3248ac57a11debdd24a37d0236cc8da2da909170e5bf4)\n* [Worker Proposal 05/2020 - 06-2020 ](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x07a712fd4e18fdf0c2db63fdec9071366c493c30492a7302823b84fdeee47fd9)\n* [Worker Proposal 04/2020 ](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xf3ace9e04caccd90316c344ba3bd32408498f1851a3db08bfbcf7b88181d6c47)","title":"AugustoL Contribution Work Proposal #3","hash":"QmQwjUB6Y6AUVFt8SqRnpR6dneAz5rS7DQmv2afJh5SPuL"},"0xb1abb97f74d0a945ee307454a19b4adb6c82302e6e61867a65aee705c638a8a6":{"description":"This is a signal proposal for a DXdao collaboration with Hats to create hacker incentive vaults to protect DXdao’s contracts and products \n\nHats is a decentralized cybersecurity incentive network.

This included pulling all REP holder addresses and addresses of wallets that participated in the DXD bonding curve, screening them with blockchain investigations software, breaking down the results by risk score, and manually investigating wallet addresses the software scored as risky.\n\n(-) Struggled to generate useful analysis on LPs to Omen. When I began, I was unable to query several relevant contracts in Dune Analytics (was receiving a permission denied error that no one was able to decipher). About a month and a half later I was able to query the contracts, but struggled to associate the addresses emitted by the contracts with the party ultimately responsible for effectuating the transactions. I asked for help from several Omen squad members: @KadenZipfel provided some help, but I struggled to implement some of his suggestions. I also reached out to @0xVenky but I missed the first call we had scheduled, and he has been very busy with other Omen related tasks since.\n\nLessons learned:\n\n15 hours a week is unrealistic : While I have worked 15 hours a week some weeks, specifically during the blockchain investigation, most weeks I have worked closer to 6-7 hours a week (because I was blocked technically or waiting for folks to get back to me with guidance/feedback). I spent a lot of that time debugging errors in Dune Analytics and The Graph. So, my next worker proposal will be for 5 hours a week. I think I might end up working more than that, and if I am, I can adjust in a future worker proposal.\n\nBringing on support for technical tasks: The Omen team is very busy and I don’t think it’s realistic to receive hand-holding on analytics tasks. To that end I have identified a data engineer and a machine learning engineer who are interested in Web3 governance and prediction markets respectively. I will work with the machine learning engineer to generate those metrics. I will also work with the data engineer to develop metrics on REP holder engagement for a project @Tammy is working on. By offloading some of this technical work to interested parties I will be freed up to focus on where I can add the most value; working on compliance and legal issues with @Tammy.\n\nTl;dr; I enjoy working with DXdao but I need to refocus on tasks that are suited for my skill-set.

I believe that I alongside the DXbiz Squad are continuing to expand on this each month. Many actions, small and large, lead to achieving this goal\n* **Did OK:** Though it can have friction, I think hard questions are important in DXdao and can lead to conversation that improves things including sharing of information and more open dialogue about the state of things.\n* **Needs Improvement:** I should do a better job of raising these topics and bringing them to discussion in the correct environment, making them easier for people to have open dialogue without causing initial conflict.\n\nAs outlined in my kickoff proposal, my commitment percentage for June is 90% so I am adjusting accordingly.\n\n**Proposal Summary:**\n\nSummary of compensation would be:\n\n* 8,100 USD to be paid in xDai (9,000 xDAI x 90% = 8,100)\n* Approval for: 17,100 USD (19,000 x 90% = 17,100) to be paid in DXD in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff when the work agreement finishes.

Guilds, of course, being the main one but not only this, as we get the dxvote contracts back from audit we are aiming to have a large release at the end of Q2 also. There are a lot of exciting things down the line and a good period with no major conferences for us to get things shipped.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n* Get both dxvote and guilds sent off to audit\n* Release guilds leading with swpr guilds - coordinate with swapr and dxvoice\n  * Social media build up educating people around what guilds solves and improves\n* The aim for the refactor (second stage of the roadmap) is to have it launched by end of Q2 which is around the end of this proposal, so if not launched it should be very close to\n  * UI redesign (efficient reuse of guilds components)\n  * Cache refactor (Modularise, simplify and make faster)\n* Begin planning governance 2.0 in more detail\n* Have more discussions and brainstorming around improvements to 2.0, especially regarding on-ramps and aspects other DAOs may find important\n* Help with twitter spaces educating around governance\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n* Managing both production as well as a new beta deployment\n* Balancing project lead responsibilities with development work\n* Leading DXvote calls and representing the project in DXdao calls\n* Finishing current development efforts and laying the groundwork for gov 2.0 according to 2022 roadmap\n* Coordinating between different teams in DXdao for guilds and feature requests, etc\n* Managing project and sprints to ensure the team is moving forward in the most efficient and prioritised way to deliver our goals\n* Constant discussion and thinking through what certain decisions could mean for gov 2.0 and the governance dynamic after&during release\n* Taking an overall large part in the direction of DXdao\n\n**Reflection on last worker period:**\n\n**Did well:**\n\n* **Development on guilds is coming to completion**. We now have the majority of major features complete with just a few final additions.\n* **Smart contract development** - With the help of @AugustoL we now have most of the team actively contributing to smart contract development. Improving processes and reliance on one developer as well as being on track to get dxvote and guilds contracts away for audit. Still a way to go but an amazing start.\n* **Reflecting & improving** - Coming out of Denver we had a lot of recent changes in contributors to the team I don't think I was working very effectively, feeling a little overwhelmed and scatterbrained. With the help of the entire team, we had incredibly constructive retrospectives on how we work with great suggestions around the availability of information, sprints, discussions and more. After taking time to focus on how to fix this and chatting with other Project managers (thanks @Zett and @0xVenky) I think I have come out more able to manage DXgov and the team has been doing a great job.\n* **DXgov features** - There have been some features I had thought out quite some time ago for DXgov’s products that could help set it apart from the competition and the iteration and execution of these with the team have been super exciting to see. I really can't wait to demo all of these to you shortly.\n  * **Proposal creation UX** - The first was an expansion of the ENS ownership idea to more configurations, the main one being a rich data configuration for contracts meaning that we can provide a far greater user experience for people creating proposals than is possible with just the solidity data as a lot of expertise goes into understanding and creating proposals.\n  * **Social layer** - The next is the social layer of governance that has been long dreamed of by many in DXdao and with the recent recruitment of @CarlB who came to us via Denver’s hackathon it is coming soon. A lot of thought, prototyping and design have been put into this coming feature to make it more than just a forum whilst being as decentralised but usable as possible.\n\n* **Tech planning** - The suggestion (I believe from Kenny) to run tech planning sessions was an excellent one and we have had many successful sessions that helped iterate on ideas and spread awareness of future plans. With this way of working we have also started planning in more detail the next step of the roadmap, refactoring. Miro board - https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOFSd4aY=/ github discussions - https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/discussions\n* **DXDenver** - I think at each conference I get better and better at this and this was no exception. It's always great fun introducing people to DXdao that have no real concept of what real decentralisation actually looks like and what it can do. The hackathon being a huge success and having people come and ask questions on top of what we have built was also super exciting.\n\n**Did ok:**\n\n* **Public speaking** - I did my first public speaking event in Denver on a panel with @Powers and @AugustoL on governance 2.0. I was pretty nervous but thankful to be on a stage with two veterans. We were pretty rushed for time and I was underprepared but I am excited to doing more things like this and improving over time. I was also on a panel for swarm’s online hackathon speaking about governance with some of the most well known early people to the DAO space including Matan, Griff Green and more. Most of the topics went very philosophical but it was a fun experience.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naMLVHK9hp0&t=4155s\n\n* **DXloan idea** - Not made public anywhere but I was working on a proposal for an under collateralized loan for contributors using REP and vested DXD. This is something we have talked about previously but never really moved much with due to it being quite difficult. For now, I think I’m putting it on hold for a variety of reasons but it was a good experience building a proposal and getting great feedback on it.\n\n**Could have done better:**\n\n* **Transparency** - So far guilds have still very much been under wrap with the extent of what others see being the designs at most. Of course, being fully transparent isn't super simple when the product is being built from the ground up but I think it's around the time now when we should be getting more feedback, especially as the UI will be reused for DXvote.\n* **Onboarding** - Although our two new developers, @CarlB and @vangrim, have been doing an incredibly good job I don't think I can take much credit for it. Partially bad timing with EthDenver as well as me just being a little distracted and unprepared for onboarding more people. There is a lot more I can do to better prepare for future onboarding (although we should be good resource wise for a while).\n\n**Timeframe**: 2 months\n\n**Compensation**: Level 6\n\n**Salary** -\n\nI am planning on setting up a company in Portugal possibly some time in this worker proposal period and so will update with details if this happens.\n\n**1st month -**\n\n$8000 DAI\n\n$6000 DXD\n\n0.1667% REP\n\n**2nd month:**\n\n$8000 DAI\n\n$6000 DXD\n\n0.1667% REP","title":"Ross Neilson Worker Proposal 18/4/2022-18/6/2022 1/2","hash":"QmcUeoUixHoUWv9yTmbiU3e7Sk8aqXTovqDrXEtqTQUuVu"},"0xb3cda1e55c71963a80942cafc2d9e6e02e7a98afd597a508107d0f1ba27bb121":{"description":"SkyMine Labs currently has 40,873.29 REP on mainnet DXdao.\n\nSkyMine Labs currently has 11,593.99 REP on xDai xDXdao.\n\nThis proposal is a request to add the difference of 29,279.30 REP to SkyMine Labs account on xDXdao\n\nCryptographic signature of SkyMine Labs:\n\nBEGIN KEYBASE SALTPACK SIGNED MESSAGE. kXR7VktZdyH7rvq v5weRa0zkTrmVHg pcaR9dXSoiL3vDx OL43ajBZ6IZcITY iJEtsaTOTbmGu7n Y6ELcL8I2rqTk08 hHzAd1pkSA1DxwO y2RTDEi9KU3zdjO cpIVloxyjqEU2ou ZjLwl0HScZ3nubC NwE90vht80UB1lW xps40LUBHZOEPiN LAqie3DowlMzBLk G7UoXiOMVuZCnmk f7sA50V1ucKbky.

In this process, DXdao strives to use unstoppable, decentralized technologies that allow it to operate and govern while maintaining its core values.\n\nDuring this journey, DXdao often encounters situations where the tool or service needed may not exist. In this scenario, DXdao is often exploring what is possible, what can be built, and who can build it. Sometimes, DXdao is able to fill the need itself, and other times, DXdao hires someone to build what is needed. And finally, there are times when these needs remain unsolved.\n\nFor this reason, DXdao is always looking for projects and teams that are building products that fill these needs and will be important in a decentralized world.\n\nToday, DXdao has the opportunity to accelerate the work being done in this field, and would like to present the idea of DXventures.\n\n**Introduction of DXventures** \nDXventures is a focused, internal investment fund to seek out and invest in promising projects that are solving the pain points of decentralized organizations. The problems that DXdao needs solved are the same problems that all DAOs will likely face. If we believe that the future will be full of these types of organizations, then we probably also believe that teams building solutions to these problems are also likely good investments.\n\n**Why DXventures is important for DXdao**\nFor the past couple months, the DXdao community has been actively discussing the topic of “How does DXdao collaborate, incubate and partner with entrepreneurs, projects and communities?” often as part of the DXbiz Weekly Meeting and in discussion channels.\n\nDXdao is already having conversations with a few projects about funding needs to accelerate the progress of those projects.\n\nDXventures is a way to formally establish a program within DXdao to pursue these opportunities.\n\nDXventures will also be a beneficial addition to DXdao’s use of its treasury, becoming a key part of its diversified holdings.\n\nDXventures is also a great way to create deal flow for Mesa and Swapr. You can imagine a clear path for ideas to become revenue generating entities:\n\nPain point for decentralized org\n\nTeam with idea to solve pain point\n\nDXventures provides seed funding for team to build out idea\n\nDXdao incubates\n\nSolution gains traction (and is used by DXdao)\n\nIDO on Mesa for token sale\n\nSwapr liquidity for secondary trading\n\nFurther relationship with project\n\n**Proposed Structure for DXventures**\nThis post proposes an initial structure for DXventures.\n\nDXdao would commit and earmark $1m of the treasury to be used for DXventures.\n\nDXdao would seek out opportunities to invest up to $100k each in projects seeking seed or growth capital.\n\nDXdao would remain flexible when it comes to the terms and structure of these investments. If the project has a token, there could be a funding-for-tokens exchange. If no token exists, there could be an on-chain agreement.\n\nTo help mitigate risks, a staged funding ladder where the investment happens in stages could be implemented.\n\nDXdao exists as a global on-chain collective, and new ways of interacting and investing in organizations will likely have to be created.\n\n**Opportunities for DXventures**\nQuestion: What types of projects will DXventures be looking to invest in?\n\nAnswer: Projects that are creating things that DXdao needs!\n\nExamples:\n\nDecentralized Medium\nDecentralized payroll\nDecentralized key management\nDecentralized node operation\nDecentralized repository\nDecentralized code collaboration\nDecentralized …\nOther (probably decentralized) cool ideas!\n\nNext Steps\n- Community discussion, improvements and feedback around idea\n- Refine Proposal\n- On-chain Proposal\n\nIf passes:\n\n- Launch DXventures to the world\n- Launch with a couple initial investments\n\n\n**Follow-up related to DXventures**\n\nOver the past three weeks there has been ongoing discussions and general support of the DXventures initiative from the community with no notable objections.\n\nDuring this period, we have also had a proposal to authorize and fund xDai base for DXdao. ([Proposal] Authorize and fund xDai base)\nhttps://daotalk.org/t/proposal-authorize-and-fund-xdai-base/2651\n\nxDXdao on xDai can now be used to “Vote on signal proposals related to DXdao governance”\n(Alchemy | DAOstack)\nhttps://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x2a4f24200eb1ef626e9aea29bad2494689f979c00c6fff17b5b0cd38712be426\n\nThere has also been increasing discussions around different investment opportunities DXdao currently has in the pipeline, and also around the mechanics of how these deals could be structured/completed.\n\nThe next step is to raise a Signal Proposal on xDXdao for DXdao community to vote on the DXventures initiative.\n\nAs of now, it looks like each individual opportunity/investment will likely require two additional proposals:\n\nAfter community discussion around an opportunity, and a general soft consensus to move forward, there should be an internal Proposal for member to vote on that specific opportunity.\n\nThe second proposal would then be a Proposal submitted by the Project receiving the investment (with the help of DXdao contributors) including the terms of the deal and the commitment from each side.\n\nThe process will likely evolve as we progress down this path.","title":"Signal Proposal: Support for DXventures","hash":"QmR8EgHC5Dfvcpnh2PHnEbcp7k8W8Ek6rSaBLGQr2roJ2E"},"0xb479ea4cf954a2a3073611718c1bd22a900da37035c0efc1d4e59b704ae0fdaa":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

Full-time with 40 workable days/2 months\n\n**Position:** DXvoice coordinator, Community Leader, Internal Operations and Documentation\n\n## Reflection on proposal:\n\n#### In reflection of this proposal, [May - June](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-contributor-proposal-for-05-2022-to-06-2022/4164), what I think I did well includes:\n\n- **Community Growth** - The community has been growing at a respectable pace despite overarching market conditions. Community calls remain as the leading DXdao call for attendance, lots of new faces joining in on daily conversations through our community channels and more. Excited to continue bolstering these efforts.\n\n- **Content Quality** - Across the multitude of DXvoice initiatives, the quality level of our content has increased dramatically - of course, over the past year or so, but seemingly more-so within the previous months. Between articles, social media content, design, and everything in-between DXvoice is in an incredible condition. Coordinating the efforts of the squad has been a privilege. \n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **Public Figure** - I've spoken several times about wanting to project my personal voice and opinions outward more - but have yet to find a rhythm or audience that sticks. Repetition is key here; alongside general community efforts I aim to put myself out there more - even if only steps at a time. _Someone_ needs to communicate the importance of decentralization.\n\n- **SWPR Emissions Targets** - Due to general insanity as of late, adjustments to individual pairs in the SWPR emissions schedule have gone by the wayside. This was rectified in the end of the period (prepared mid June for early July target) with some large adjustments to both Gnosis Chain and Arbitrum. Going forward, I will be leading discussions into the future of SWPR emissions and what it means for the protocol - as Swapr is nearing on completion of its first year of liq mining. \n\n## Goals/Responsibilities:\n\n**[65%] DXvoice Coordination and Execution**\n\n* Lead DXdao’s “DXvoice” squad\n  * Organize, run, and manage various initiatives including but not limited to squad calls, marketing processes, community calls, events, content coordination, etc…\n  * Explore the potential for DXvoice to further become a more independent entity with its own goals.

Following that community discussion, Omen and Swapr [were deployed to xDai](https://dxdao.medium.com/omen-latest-release-launches-scalar-markets-and-expands-to-xdai-chain-f906532b49d9), Swapr [was deployed to the Arbitrum Testnet ](https://dxdao.medium.com/dxdao-expands-to-arbitrum-cb85b1f00da2)and DXdao [authorized an xDXdao base on xDai ](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x2a4f24200eb1ef626e9aea29bad2494689f979c00c6fff17b5b0cd38712be426)to handle worker proposals and other governance processes.\n\nxDai has been an informative experience in the multi-chain world for DXdao governance and its products, but the community is excited about Layer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum One, that offer scalability and maintain the security properties of Ethereum. \n\nDXdao contributors have been working closely with Arbitrum team members for the last several months and have deployed versions of DXvote, a new decentralized governance system that uses DXD for holographic consensus, and Swapr onto Arbitrum One.\n\n### Details\n\nThis proposal:\n\n*   Authorizes a DXvote deployment on Arbitrum One as an official DXdao base (“aDXdao”). aDXdao features a new voting machine that uses DXD as a staking token in holographic consensus. This base can be used to govern any DXdao product on Arbitrum One and conduct any other DXdao-related business on Arbitrum One. It will use the latest REP mapping from xDai. \n*   Authorizes a Swapr deployment on Arbitrum One as official deployment on Arbitrum One. This deployment can be integrated into future Swapr.eth releases\n*   Commits $2.25m in DXdao capital to be bridged over to Arbitrum One to be used for liquidity provisioning on Swapr ($2m) and working capital for aDXdao ($250k). \n\n### Risks and Considerations\n\n[Arbitrum One](https://github.com/AugustoL/dxvote) is a new Layer 2 scaling solution built by [Offchain Labs](https://offchainlabs.com/) that uses an Optimistic Rollup design. This is new technology that aims to maintain the underlying security of Ethereum mainnet by batching transactions offchain and submitting condensed versions on-chain. A sequencer (or operator) does the transaction ordering and initially this will be controlled by the Offchain Labs team. DXdao assets in aDXdao and Swapr may be susceptible to bugs or other initial problems in Arbitrum One’s initial deployment. Arbitrum One has been on testnet for more than 9 months and received several audits, so this risk should be minimized. Offchain Labs will maintain an admin key for several months in case of a bug.\n\nBridging assets also represents another risk opportunity. The specifics of how DXdao sends assets to aDXdao are outside of the scope of this proposal. DXdao has been capable at bridging assets to xDai with no problems, so this risk is low and dependent on the security of the bridge used. \n\nAdditionally, any assets deployed in Swapr are subject to price volatility and impermanent loss. Trading fees and the benefit to Swapr growth from DXdao liquidity provisioning likely outweigh any risks.","title":"Expand DXdao to Arbitrum One [Signal Proposal]","hash":"QmP8hMU6knFyuGBEtayNuPnJt9Xbc2dNLKksC7bvaBZ6tJ"},"0xb70f893ee60b155804517dce83c47d0c2a5054618b4bc147c582d30e9d549476":{"description":"**Background:**\n\nThis will be my second full time contributor period.

Proof of this work can both be found [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/commits/develop?author=luzzif) and [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/commits/feature/new-campaign-page-design?author=luzzif).\n\n- Developed a relayer to help the DAO create liquidity mining campaigns directly from governance. The relayer is funded by the funding and voting power scheme, and called directly (in order to actually create distributions) using the multicall scheme. The code for it can be found [here](https://github.com/luzzif/dxdao-liquidity-mining-relayer-contracts). The relayer has successfully been tested on xDai and is ready to be used by the DAO.\n\n- Added Swapr support to DefiLlama. Both xDai and mainnet's TVL is now shown on DefiLlama. Proof [here](https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters/pull/113).\n\n- Made DXstats multi-chain. DXstats now officially supports multi-chain stats in production. A dropdown has been implemented to switch between networks (xDai and mainnet currently supported). Proof [here](https://github.com/nicoelzer/dxstats/commits/main?author=luzzif).\n\n- On Omen, started implementing ERC20 token wrapping. The work is divided between dedicated wrapper contracts and frontend updates. The idea is to have ERC20 markets be created as soon as the implementations are deployed, leaving old markets ERC1155-based, with the possibility of upgrading them. If a market becomes ERC20-compatible, and a user still has ERC1155 tokens for that market, he's asked to upgrade (i.e. wrap) his tokens to be able to continue trading on the market. This creates interesting possibilities such as creating Swapr markets with Omen outcome tokens. The work also has implications on conditional farming, that will need ERC20 wrapping to work correctly. The proof of work is visible [here](https://github.com/protofire/omen-exchange/pull/1828) (frontend) and [here](https://github.com/luzzif/erc1155-to-erc20-wrapper-contracts) (wrapping smart contracts).

Here is the [DAOtalk post](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-recap-april-may-2021/2985) for recap. [The DAOtalk post has the original full worker scope](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-apr-may-2021/2805), which covered:\n\n\n\n*   Governance (50%)\n*   Swapr/Ecosystem and Product Development (30%)\n*   Biz dev/marketing/community (20%)\n\nSome things I thought I did well:\n\n\n\n*   Swapr Liquidity Deposits - there were two separate deposits into Swapr that were coordinated over this time, [\"250 ETH #2\"](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xd4d5e354fe501dbcce2b8b324c8f392490c7a3f086b4c0952356c1895d09d7fa) and [\"400 ETH\"](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xa2fa2560f9a595140d2100fb85d8eb5421a8fd527bc4a55ea48799ab2bd1fdb6). In total, [$2.1m DXdao liquidity on xDai](https://dxstats.eth.link/#/account/0x3921d59090810c1d52807cd8ca1ea2289e1f89e6) and [$900k on mainnet](https://dxstats.eth.link/#/account/0xc088e949b9643d5c47a188084579b8d19b1b1112), which was below $5m goal in proposal but liquidity levels seem to be in line with community preferences. These deposits require proposals on mainnet & xDai and also multi-sig coordination to purchase assets and bridge over. \n*   Onboarding and working with new Contributor UX/Treasury contributors (@Melanie, @allyq and @fluidDrop). I can’t take credit for their great work, but I think these additions have enhanced DXdao’s governance capabilities. Melanie and Ally have helped with proposal submissions and tracking DXD/REP awards. Similarly, [fluiddrop’s Q1 treasury report](https://daotalk.org/t/q1-treasury-overview/2833) and other efforts around organizing DXdao’s treasury activity have streamlined governance processes in general.\n*   Discord, forum communication and content production - I think I’ve done a good job of staying engaged on community channels and building out the #Governance channel in Discord. I’ve also worked with Keenan on [March](https://dxdao.medium.com/dxdao-month-in-review-march-2021-6dd11f6b9fce) and [April’s Month in Review](https://dxdao.medium.com/dxdao-month-in-review-april-2021-242b70037ffc) and the [Pause the Curve medium post](https://dxdao.medium.com/dxdao-hits-pause-on-dxd-bonding-curve-98166199925a). \n\nSome things I thought I did okay:\n\n\n\n*   DXD buyback - helped pass [DXD Buyback Program signal proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8). This is an important initiative, so I say “okay” because it has gone a little bit slower than expected and we are still considering changing it after the first few weeks. So far, [three](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc7f5857598bc525e5d03ac276ba1057a7a53f870baa1bf4a9836fadcc0d81447) [buyback](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x9fa712eb93b1daf0372727c127a4e563d280c738c578555ea5a0980439d01408) [orders](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xaacd3dc7c3aeea0e2d0cbf8b243cfe5b9deec896028f0ad02fcbe63a0909e95e) have been placed and [132 DXD has been purchased](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing) at an average price of 0.1148 ETH/DXD. I/we can do a better job of communicating the orders, how to sell into them and general updates on the program’s progress.\n*   xDai/multichain governance - DXdao has two bases with plans for a 3rd. This requires a higher level of coordination and constant rebalancing ([two proposals](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x9cbf24816d55d2e34dd62ddfbd8407081147bf7e794cb5c658626d2f14740704) in [April/May](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x685c942cd5650517e2081d5637c8b39693ed57e6ffa4516023200f74727cb685) for fund transfers in addition to the Swapr deposits). I thought things have gone relatively smoothly on xDai, BUT there has been confusion on REP syncing and I have not done a good job of getting consensus on a plan. Built [Worker Comp Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18K5jVn8HmwQZ9Ve48S90vQAYklIm0heKTTDGHfWXc5s/edit?usp=sharing) and working on [Claiming Mainnet Awards](https://daotalk.org/t/claiming-mainnet-rep-awards-on-mainnet/2968) for contributors.\n*   Governance & Product strategy meetings - organized and hosted these every week in April and May. I missed a few weeks of notes for Governance discussion and I think the product strategy call could use a bit more continuity and followup. I’m open to ideas on how to change/improve product strategy chat.\n\nSome things I thought I did not do well\n\n\n\n*   Communicate DXdao story to a broader audience. I still have not made progress on building DXdao’s brand/narrative in the industry, particularly as it relates to governance. This is something that DXdao struggles with more broadly, but I haven’t found the time/angle/courage to make DXdao relevant in the current crypto discourse.\n*   DXD Tokenomics WG - I did not get around to creating this, but there has been progress in the community on this front with John’s post on a [new DXD token model](https://daotalk.org/t/proposed-dxd-token-model/2898). I think this is important and will work with community to move to a new model.\n*   Recruiting - I think the right approach has been taken, but we’re still waiting on the fruits of it. We are still looking for a Marketing lead, but we did hire a recruiting firm last month and already interviewed some great candidates, but I have not been particularly helpful in bringing new people into DXdao. \n\nCompensation\n\n\n\n*   Level 5, 90% time commitment\n*   ETH/stablecoin compensation\t$7,200\n*   Mainnet REP award (month)\t2,314.5\n*   Number of DXD vested for 2 years with 1 year cliff\t10.33\n\nPrevious Worker Proposals:\n\n\n\n*   [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [July/August]](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-governance-biz-dev-and-content-focused-rep-request/1775)\n*   [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [August/September]](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-governance-biz-dev-and-community-request-for-worker-compensation/1888)\n*   [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [October/November]](https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-caney-fork/2152)\n*   [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [December/January]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-12-1-1-31/2491)\n*   [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [February/March]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-feb-march-2021/2661)\n*   [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [April/May]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-apr-may-2021/2805)","title":"Caney Fork Worker Recap and Payout (April-May 2021)","hash":"QmQR64G7u4CMDkk4PA6PTCY53G6Qb49VuqgfvH8vU2nKpc"},"0xb99a4a8f25dba21992be35a8a63a09b3f080e0634f3adb2033ed11ba05c0d8de":{"description":"Proposal to be used to test signed votes using the DXDVotingMachine","title":"Signed Votes Test Proposal","hash":"QmWLc53M8UU6SHwBDmWHt9fA4LHM15PXVPfaNAnG5iQdD4"},"0xb9a6241c78d195f33671a34e5b171e4780b82f5509506e1ba35e1373703d66d6":{"description":"This proposal explains the new compensation structure at DXdao. The new structure is meant to ensure long-term contributor alignment with DXdao and remain competitive with market salary rates. Once this proposal passes, contributors to DXdao can reference it for compensation in proposals starting from the date of proposal passage (UTC time).\n\nThe new proposed contributor level guide and compensation can be found on ipfs [here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPpkUZnvyXg9KWEMR6BoLT398CThoBD8B995z4kZ8X2VB), as well as in the chart below.\n\n**DXD compensation**\n\nContributors should use the current DXD price at the time of proposal submission. All DXD compensation should be vested linearly over 3 years with a one year cliff. Governance can implement more specific processes to calculate the current price and ensure that proposal submission times are not gamed. To account for the price volatility for crypto assets and protect the treasury in unforeseen events, DXD compensation has a floor price of which the DXD price shall be calculated. The initial floor price should be set at $225. This ensures a maximum annual 3.37% release of current treasury DXD figures, compoundable over three years.\n\nDXdao on-chain governance may adjust this number at any time as it sees necessary.\n\n**Determining compensation levels**\n\nCurrent and future contributors should closely assess the language presented in the compensation structure descriptions and have a discussion with their squad leader or other relevant contributors to their vertical.\n\nContributors are encouraged to meet with at least two (2) other contributors to discuss the new compensation level. Previous Level 5 contributors and squad leader should meet with at least two (2) other squad leaders to discuss what level you would fall under in the new Compensation Structure. @melaniedavis and the Contributor UX squad can also provide support.\n\nContributors should make an educated decision surrounding their compensation level based on the updated level descriptions and any feedback received. If a contributor doesn’t feel a level completely describes them, they should start at a lower level. Although there is no direct conversion, generally speaking contributors are likely to fall within the following levels:\n\n\n**Current Level \tNew level to consider**\n\nLevel 1 \t    Level 1-3\n\nLevel 2 \t    Level 2-4\n\nLevel 3 \t    Level 3-5\n\nLevel 4 \t    Level 5-7\n\nLevel 5 \t    Level 6-8\n\nFuture contributors are encouraged to read the level descriptions and consult with their squad leader and the Contributor UX squad to determine an appropriate level.\n\nUltimately, DXdao’s on-chain governance has the final say.\n\n**Promotions**\n\nLike all worker engagements, promotions are led by the individual contributor, who can apply in a new worker proposal to be at a higher level. The community will provide feedback on the worker scope in the forum and squad leads are encouraged to vocalize when a contributor in their squad has misrepresented their level, be it to the low or high end. REP holders will use various signals from the community and collective to determine whether or not to approve the “promotion” to a higher level.\n\n**Product tokens**\n\nProduct tokens will be left up to product squads, but if a DXdao contributor is focused on a specific product, then a portion of that contributor’s DXD compensation may be substituted with the specific product token.\n\n**Additional FAQ and forum post can be found** [here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-compensation-structure-overhaul-june-2021-draft-proposal/3066) ","title":"DXdao Compensation Structure Overhaul - 2021","hash":"QmUaakp5EkSy7brY3JJ5oH5MgJCeYq5JdzJguYopPtxtr7"},"0xb9a6d39ba2bd0e1384a8091063e15cf98590c065e4b0f939fb6056e0b8b5fb2a":{"description":"Space Inch is a development studio that has been providing contract work across Aqua and now Swapr. This is their 13th proposal. The proposal below is a payout for December 2022 totaling $4,896. Below is a recap of the contributions along with links to a Master Service Agreement and Scope of Work that govern the relationship going forward. These are written as contractual agreements between DXdao and Space Inch. Passage of this proposal is a “signature” from DXdao to those agreements.\n\nTimeframe\n\nDecember 1 - 31, 2022\n\nResponsibilities\n\nOskar (karczuRf):\nDecember was Oskar’s last month as a Swapr full-time developer and because of that he was mainly focused on closing all open issues and knowledge transfer to Swapr’s team members.\nAt that point his main task was to fix all small bugs related wth LP-Zapping (this feature was detailed explained in November summary) which were found during internal tests. All mentioned issues were solved and the final work was presented during Dxdao weekly meeting as a demo. So to sum up Oskar was able to develop the complex feature which now is waiting for next steps decided by Swapr team. The PR can be found on Swapr-dapp github repo: Feat/lp zapping by karczuRF · Pull Request #1596 · ImpeccableHQ/swapr-dapp · GitHub.\nApart from that Oskar merged and closed PRs related with Dxdao’s smart-contracts migration to Hardhat environment. This is a big improvement for the future development and also was necessery to implement another features developed by Oskar which are protocol fee split and swap relayer (both features were described previously).

See the [PDF](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmf6imfDsxjtfjqJN92pYJm9KGd1DzN8tKHk2HJLA2Kr2r) and [CSV ](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVkZRUWeqesBE6WoWEUof9DHo6thigHUNJ6gFrQP5eLGE) of the vested DXD distribution.. This was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/approve-dxd-vesting-distribution-to-multiple-addresses-signal-proposal/3659). \n\n\n\n**Background**\n\nDXdao’s [Worker Compensation Guidelines](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0xc9ebd5e6c96b87ee1ab09cbe7f301eb2c885068073ca4db4a5a01ab5c40ecf5b) stipulate that contributors are to be paid in both stablecoins that are immediately receivable every month and DXD that is to be “vested continuously for two years with a one year cliff”. Some contributors have DXD vesting in smart contracts on Ethereum mainnet. Because setting up a vesting contract incurs high gas costs and requires some technical skill and that this DXD was not immediately redeemable, many contributors have not formally received their DXD. Instead, it is a ‘DXD debt’ for DXdao.\n\nThe Contributor UX squad [started tracking unissued DXD for contributors](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-dxd-tracking/2900) in May by matching up a passed on-chain proposal (on mainnet and xDai) with their DXD compensation. The latest sheet shows DXD accrued through proposals that have passed as of the December 3 2021. For ease of accounting and deployment purposes, the vesting date for DXD will be at the beginning of the month it was earned.\n\nThere has been [discussion on where to vest the DXD](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-worker-payout-draft-proposal/3449) and how to manage the process. Soft consensus was reached on the [Nov. 3 Governance discussion](https://daotalk.org/t/governance-discussion-nov-3-2021/3463) to have the DXgov squad facilitate the DXD vesting contract creation on xDai. \n\n**Details**\n\nThis proposal authorizes the DXgov team to facilitate vesting contract creation and DXD deposits into the vesting contracts that abide by the amounts and vesting dates to the specified addresses as laid out in this spreadsheet ([PDF](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmf6imfDsxjtfjqJN92pYJm9KGd1DzN8tKHk2HJLA2Kr2r) and [CSV](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVkZRUWeqesBE6WoWEUof9DHo6thigHUNJ6gFrQP5eLGE))\n\nContributors with earned DXD must initiate the vesting process and confirm the address on xDai before any DXD is transferred to a vesting contract.  \n\n**Risks and Considerations**\n\nThe vesting contracts will be deployed onto xDai, which means contributors’ DXD payments will depend it for security as well as the bridge that connects to Ethereum. Stubbornly high gas prices on Ethereum mainnet as well [as positive signs on a potential merger or acquisition by Gnosis](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-16-gnosis-chain-xdai-gnosis-merge/1904) suggest that the future of xDai is bright.\n\nThis proposal relies on facilitation from DXdao contributors as well as initiation by contributors with earned DXD.","title":"Approve DXD vesting distribution to multiple contributor addresses","hash":"QmXC33KNAYn1BGzp7W2iTHiq1zq4FqGLx2BxhyWjdesAB5"},"0xba51397737fb0defc9ff449769c0d43a9f9f0aea9d2590e99df758248277a8b1":{"description":"This proposal is for the review of updates made to the Gnosis Protocol Relayer as well as updates made to the Swapr Farming contracts.\n\n### Scope\n\nCommit Range for Gnosis Protocol Relayer: https://github.com/nicoelzer/gnosis-protocol-relayer/compare/319d6ff3ece08e2b854f0d7b0a8a0fe12893ba79..83fc710eb0f43368e2abd602a7a896bb03f451d2\n1 day to complete\n\nCommit Range for Swapr Farming Contracts:\nhttps://github.com/luzzif/erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts/compare/ee4f2b4298e00fdb044af6220e325e62c20af893...b6f6ff03794c7df29517bfe3048cdc71a7b59b4b\n2 days to complete\n\n### Cost\n\n1 day of time already paid for by excess time from [this proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x211d55afbe0aa9a0645061241775b911311ec762833d91074c51d08f56461a04).

The extension on the buyback program was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-program-signal-proposal/2890). This funding proposal and the subsequent trade proposal use an updated version of the GP Relayer than the one referenced in the DXD Buyback Program Signal Proposal in order to add Swapr to the GP Relayer’s exchangeFactoryWhitelist.\n\nThe DXD Buyback Program Signal proposal stipulates that the purchase amount should be based on the DXD Average Daily Trading Volume (ADTV). [According to the most recent on-chain data and estimates](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmU1gB6iJbEgxK2BF9ugmH4LSzmwqSA934jb8Y3aieTwtk), DXD has averaged $134k over the last 3 months, so this proposal sends 9.72 WETH to the GP relayer on xDai, identified as `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`, using a [$3446.54 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum). Further explanation of the [GP relayer can be found here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmd8TCEr6syKxAnmuBH3hsyvxfSgRJgANLTTorp3JGZY77). \n\nThis proposal falls under the DXD Buyback Program, because the value of the DXD circulating supply is less than the value in the ETH in DXdao’s treasury, [according to Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dxdao) and [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521).\n\nThis proposal sends funds to the GP Relayer. A separate proposal with the order parameters must also be submitted to place the order.

The permissions setting proposal failed to update the permissions and upon inspection it was discovered that the “Max time for execution” which is set to 1 day is actually counting from proposal submission rather than from the proposal passing (note other than Augusto observing this we haven’t double checked which we should do in the morning to be absolutely sure this is the case). This setting therefore is such that it prevents any proposal whatsoever to pass via boosting, because all the timelines are longer than 1 day from submission. The only way to pass a proposal on this deployment of DXvote (the current Arbitrum base) is to pass proposals by absolute majority, i.e. with > 50% of the vote. We have success in passing votes by absolute majority on xDai, so we were initially hopeful that this could be done on Arbitrum, but there are issues here that would make it much harder than on xDai. DXvote was deployed with the same mapped addresses that we used on xDai, however, unlike xDai, the unmapped smart contract addresses were not removed. The effect of this is, relatively speaking, the same people have less percentage of the vote on the Arbitrum base. Augusto, Federico, and I started looking through addresses. While it seems possible to get > 50% it would likely be very very hard to coordinate. And what makes this approach all the more difficult here is that in order for this to work, we actually would need to pass two proposals by absolute majority, 1 day apart, and each proposal only has 24 hours to be voted on, passed, and executed from submission.\n\nThe only other way we have thought of to address this issue would be to redeploy everything. At the moment, I actually think this is the best approach. I think first thing tomorrow we should meet, confirm the above issues as true, assess, and come up with a plan. For the folks that are still awake, I am happy to hop on a call now to discuss.\n\nWe have been working very hard and tirelessly, and there is a lot of positive momentum around the launch so far, and so I understand that this can be very discouraging. But we can’t give up now. And I am optimistic we can recover with minimal damage, but it will require great coordination and determination from everyone.”\n\nThis was quite the start to the month! And indeed, as you know, we redeployed everything. This was a colossal effort from many members of the team. In particular @AugustoL and @luzzifoss were instrumental, but there was also great support from many others, including @ross, @fluidDrop, @0xVenky, @KeenanL, @sky and probably others I am failing to remember. Very proud that we were able to recover from this and for awhile Swapr was doing great on Arbitrum. What made this more significant to me is that I had been supporting the strategy of being one of the first dapps to deploy on Arbitrum, the first general purpose L2 to be open to any app to deploy.\n\n- Helping support DXgov formation\n\nThe benefit of being very late with this proposal is that I can say I think the DXgov team has been working out quite well, and a lot of the moves we made last fall set the stage for this.\n\n**What I think went well**\n\n- As described above, Arbitrum relaunch, and DXgov team rampup\n\n- Started relationship with Omega Team which has been very important.\n\n- DXretreat was great.\n\n**What I think needed improvement**\n\n- Arbitrum launch. While I am very proud of my involvement and everyone’s work on the relaunch, it would have been better if we could have caught the issues with governance prior to the launch. While we did have a thorough plan and deployments on testnet, the particular issue that bit us had to do with timescales and we could have been more careful with testing that.\n\n- Offboarding of Nissa was somewhat of a disaster. Not really sure what I could have done better given the circumstances at the time but clearly process improvements were needed. I think things have somewhat improved since.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nLevel K was already at the max amount of REP. According to the guidelines for a DXdao worker with expert level experience and a commitment level of 5, total compensation is 2 * 8000 = $16000 in stablecoins or ETH and 2 * 6000 = $12000 worth of DXD.  Applying a 6% reduction yields $15040 and $11280 worth of DXD.","title":" Level K Worker Proposal and Payout 9/2021 - 10/2021 - LATE SUBMISSION","hash":"QmZ2p6kgUYFoG5LJNAMHrPgjBzKwmRuHpA1KHLQ6SrThjy"},"0xbb58a4157d5c67229a4355131a8973988c398c6a4f74eb29c9747f99e1a376b1":{"description":"\n\n**Overview:**\n\nDue to the decentralized nature of DXdao, issues arise around paying contributors across the globe. This signal proposal calls for facilitators to offer their services to DXdao and pass a proposal on-chain to be approved as an official DXdao payment facilitator.\n\n**Details:**\n\nA number of contributors face challenges working for the DAO, as a variety of legal and tax questions arise regarding invoicing and VAT collection. This puts excessive burden and cost on contributors. If a solution is at all available, it is likely to differ per each country. \n\nAs DXdao grows, it requires more robust links to the real world. Facilitating payments to contributor is a core requirement for the functioning of the DAO. And such an activity should be geographically resistant and distributed, to avoid a single-point of failure. DXdao should facilitate payments to ensure contributors are able to collect payment easily.\n\n**CFP:**\n\nThis signal proposal is a call for proposals for service providers to offer their services to DXdao, the following information should be included in any such proposal:\n\n\n|||\n|--- |--- |\n|Taxes|Amount or % of taxes incurred|\n|Fees|Fees charged by service provider|\n|Jursidiction|Jurisdiction of incorporation of service provider|\n|Banking / FIAT offramping|Access to offramping crypto to FIAT?|\n|Banking jurisdiction|Jurisdiction of banking partners|\n|Service type|Ad-hoc or top-up|\n\n\nIn the interest of geographical independence, it would be preferable to have a number of service provides across the globe. Preferably, these would not be in tax havens (OECD / EU non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes) as that would complicate accepting payment for contributors.\n\nMoreover, due to volume being the key driver for such service providers to be sustainable, DXdao shall choose a service provider in the following regions:\n\n\n\n* Americas\n* Europe\n* Asia\n\nAfter a service provider has been approved by the DAO through on-chain governance, DXdao will be carrying the service provider fees for contributors. Contributors are, of course, free to use other services at their own cost.

We focused on improving the performance and user experience of the app, with a more polished user interface and a more performant data fetching layer.

The new contracts will be replacing our existing DXdao contracts soon and will pave way for gov 2.0. Kudos to @AugustoL for providing mentorship and guidance to the team!\n\nOn a personal note, I was working from India since the start of this proposal period, with plans to move to Sweden towards August. The visa process has taken considerably more time than I anticipated, but I'll still be moving soon. I must thank the DXgov squad for being accommodating towards my changing availability!\n\n### Did well:\n\n* Supporting DAVI development efforts, with a large refactor in our data fetching layer, adding support for native token transfers and supporting the feature freeze.\n* Work on the next generation of DXdao contracts.\n* Collaborating with the team members on planning and brainstorming. \n\n### Improve on\n\n* While my India move has been great for me mentally, I'm still working on improving my productivity.

[According to the most recent on-chain data and estimates](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmU1gB6iJbEgxK2BF9ugmH4LSzmwqSA934jb8Y3aieTwtk), DXD has averaged $146k over the last 3 months, so this proposal sends 10.21 WETH to the GP relayer on xDai, identified as `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`, using a [$3574.58 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum).

This was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-governance-stewards/4786/5). A corresponding mainnet funding proposal will also been submitted to fund Operations Guild Multisig with $8,250 Dai_\n\nThe **Governance Steward Program** is a new, experimental initiative intended to incentivize good governance and participation by compensating REP holders who are not actively contributing but spend their time helping to govern DXdao. The health of DXdao relies on REP holders making informed decisions about various proposals that affect the organization’s operations and future. Staying up to date on all the issues that these proposals may touch on requires time and effort that should be compensated. This initiative proposes to compensate governance participation directly by paying those who participate.\n\nThis proposal authorizes $8,250 in USD & $8,250 in one year vested DXD would be set aside per budgetary period to be distributed to REP holders who meet the minimum participation thresholds. \n\nThe proposed thresholds for the H1 2023 period are:\n\n\n* attend (9) governance calls and…\n* vote in at least (1) proposal per month (5 total).\n\nAll individuals with more than 0.1% of total REP are welcome to register to be a Steward (mainnet or Gnosis Chain). Stewards are eligible to earn up to $1,650 USD & DXD per budgetary period ($333.33/mo).  \n\nDXdao contributors with more than 10% of their time committed to DXdao during the steward term are not eligible to participate in the program. Participating requires finishing the program to completion of the term or you forfeit payment. Starting late is allowed but still requires participation until term completion, and you are not paid for the time you missed at the beginning.\n\n### Specification\n\n\n\n* All applicants should post on this [DAOtalk thread](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-governance-stewards/4786/5) with the following information:\n    * Name they go by to determine attendance.\n    * Wallet address where they hold their REP.\n    * Any other information they want to share.\n* Applications are verified and confirmed by a member of the Operations Guild.\n* Attendance of each governance call is taken at the beginning and end by a member of the Operations Guild.\n* At the end of the budgetary period, a report of all votes is compiled by the Operations Guild that shows the participation of each participant.\n\n\n\n### Details\nThis proposal authorizes the program as outlined above, to be administered by the Operations Guild with Caney Fork as the directly responsible entity. The mainnet funding proposal sends 8,250 Dai to the Operations Guild multisig, identified as [0x22F3BB8defB1B9A6c18da5E1496cd1b15fc79d70](https://etherscan.io/address/0x22F3BB8defB1B9A6c18da5E1496cd1b15fc79d70) on Mainnet\n\nThe DXD portion will be handled at the end of the budgetary period with the DXD vested in a single contract, with vesting starting on July 1, 2023","title":"Proposal to Establish Governance Stewards program","hash":"QmZxMgiugyLFKXbZgfw26Mvv51Fi9be7AfypWezh6C5kpH"},"0xbdb4d381864f5caae53e7251617be68ecb9afe855cea9e83534a0b83e7b9e03f":{"description":"Felix#5309  am requesting\nREP in relation to my DXdao Discord participation level.

This included pulling all REP holder addresses and addresses of wallets that participated in the DXD bonding curve, screening them with blockchain investigations software, breaking down the results by risk score, and manually investigating wallet addresses the software scored as risky.\n\n(-) Struggled to generate useful analysis on LPs to Omen. When I began, I was unable to query several relevant contracts in Dune Analytics (was receiving a permission denied error that no one was able to decipher). About a month and a half later I was able to query the contracts, but struggled to associate the addresses emitted by the contracts with the party ultimately responsible for effectuating the transactions. I asked for help from several Omen squad members: @KadenZipfel provided some help, but I struggled to implement some of his suggestions. I also reached out to @0xVenky but I missed the first call we had scheduled, and he has been very busy with other Omen related tasks since.\n\nLessons learned:\n\n15 hours a week is unrealistic : While I have worked 15 hours a week some weeks, specifically during the blockchain investigation, most weeks I have worked closer to 6-7 hours a week (because I was blocked technically or waiting for folks to get back to me with guidance/feedback). I spent a lot of that time debugging errors in Dune Analytics and The Graph. So, my next worker proposal will be for 5 hours a week. I think I might end up working more than that, and if I am, I can adjust in a future worker proposal.\n\nBringing on support for technical tasks: The Omen team is very busy and I don’t think it’s realistic to receive hand-holding on analytics tasks. To that end I have identified a data engineer and a machine learning engineer who are interested in Web3 governance and prediction markets respectively. I will work with the machine learning engineer to generate those metrics. I will also work with the data engineer to develop metrics on REP holder engagement for a project @Tammy is working on. By offloading some of this technical work to interested parties I will be freed up to focus on where I can add the most value; working on compliance and legal issues with @Tammy.\n\nTl;dr; I enjoy working with DXdao but I need to refocus on tasks that are suited for my skill-set.

New job, new type of organization, Devcon and DX retreat. \nI enjoyed each one of these. I'm learning a lot and I have the feeling there is a lot more to learn. This is very motivating, but I have to admit it gets me a bit anxious so I'm trying to take it easy and learn one thing at a time. \nI still have to familiarize myself with some concepts, which I'm confident that with time I will, and I'll be able to get more involved in the meetings.\n\nDevcon was an amazing experience, I've never been to an Ethereum conference before and I feel I made the best out of it. I had the opportunity to talk with people from other projects which was very interesting, as well as attending great talks and workshops, on both technical and social matters.\n\nThe DX retreat was awesome, it was great meeting in person with all the people on DXdao, and I enjoyed the talks a lot, they allowed me to understand better how DXdao works.\n\nMoving to work, all the contributors at DXdao, especially at DXgov, made me feel very comfortable and supported.\n\nI felt like I was up to the tasks I received and was able to fulfill them without major dependencies. \n\nI really enjoyed receiving feedback and suggestions over my work, as it helps me improve my code quality. Special thanks to Kenny, Dino and Ross for giving me feedback on my code always with constructive comments. \n\nDAVI is a very interesting project with good quality code which makes me very motivated to keep working on it. \n## What went well\n\n### Infinite Hackathon\n\n[Infinite Hackaton website](https://infinite-hackathons.eth.limo/)\n\nInfinite-hackathon’s website was a project I really enjoyed, trying to fulfill as best as I could all the requirements from the design team with the time-bound we had. It was fulfilling doing the project from scratch and I’m satisfied with how it ended.\n\n### DAVI’s Landing\n[Project DAVI Landing](https://projectdavi.eth.limo/)\n\nNot much to say here, it was a pretty basic and static web, but I’m satisfied with how it looks. \n\n### DAVI\n\nDavi’s tasks were what I enjoyed the most, I feel I have a lot to learn and that pushes me forward. \nIt was a good experience working on DAVI’s code. I felt I could understand it fastly, receiving the task and investigating it. \nThe team was very supportive, everyone was available when I needed them and very helpful. \n\n### Smart contracts\n\nI worked on some issues on the audit's smart contracts and reviewed the guys PRs. Even though the changes I made were pretty minor, I enjoyed working on solidity and I hope to do it more in the future. I also liked learning about how an audit is done and about solidity's safe patterns.\nWhat to improve\nI think I could be more participative in meetings. However, as I said before, I feel I'm still getting to know some concepts and how everything works. In time  I will be able to engage more. \n\n## Contributions \n\n### Infinite Hackathon\n\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/1\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/2\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/3\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/9\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/17\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/20\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/27\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/31\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/32\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/39\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/43\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/43\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/infinite-hackathon/pull/45\n\n### DAVI\n\nWIP:\n\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/411\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/349\n\nMerged:\n\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/issues/229\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/issues/268\n\n### DAVI Landing Page\n\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/davi-landing/pull/1\n\n### Smart Contracts\n\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/247\nhttps://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/260\n\n","title":"Tomas Pulenta Retrospective Contributor proposal [8/8/22 - 8/11/22]","hash":"QmQawB9rLcvbVv6YdZpxdfxeVpPQUEEB6xjyn4BMjrwX6x"},"0xbec6fc9ee1b1b709d2624ea914b62718d27dff4a61751de3007fb8b422c7468e":{"description":"Milton Contributor Proposal - 13/12/2021 - 06/02/2022 \n\n\n**Background:** \n\nI started collaborating with the dxgov team last December. After passing that 2-week trial period, this proposal will include the next 2 months of work (trial period). \nThe last 2-week period has been great. I was able to make progress on the goals I had set for myself and I think I was able to contribute to the team. Sure this will be a work in progress for several months, but technically and conceptually I feel much more comfortable working with on-chain architecture, web3, contracts interaction, etc. I also think that I have become more familiar with how the dxvote dapp works since I had the opportunity to work on things not so superficial like the cache, different services and stores. Even though it was tough at first, it was really good to speed up my part-time onboarding. For this proposal I will focus on continuing to collaborate with the dxgov team, contributing to the guilds MVP, and supporting dxvote. \n\n**Timeframe:** \n\n2 months starting December 13, 2021, to February 6, 2022. 20 hours per week (part-time) \n\n**Goals:** \n\n- Collaborate with the DXGov team on the DXVote project. \n\n- Gain more understanding about Guild and support MVP development \n- Work on any issue(s) and/or feature(s) that the team leader sees fit for me. \n\n- Familiarize myself with the code (Like app architecture, libraries, components structure, logic layer, cache , contracts integration) and also with deployment process, team meetings and methodology. \n\n- Learn more about Blockchain and web3 development in general and also how DXDAO operates. \n\n- Catch up with the worker proposal flow \n\n**Responsibilities:** \n\nCollaborate with the dxgov team to build Guilds MVP and support dxvote \n\n**Compensation**\n\n**Experience Level:** \n\nFor work completed from November 29 to December 31, level 3 of the previous structure.

I’m excited for the future of DXdao and the whole product suite we’re building.

If the proposal passes, this [announcement](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRDwuJ8HovZbEW7y9iQeqM5GT7dciCVnRYPCsX2LKqBAA) can be referenced with all relevant details. This was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-program-signal-proposal/2890). This is the [corresponding mainnet proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8). *\n\n### Background\n\nREP holders launched DXD last year through a [bonding curve smart contract](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa). In this design, only product revenue drives DXD value accrual; DXD holders do not directly benefit from a rise in the value of DXdao’s treasury. This will change in the upcoming [Governance 2.0 design](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xf57b8345b7bcafdff729e2441900b5340251bcc83a4a4c48c6b273eed7ecb717), but the recent appreciation of ETH in the treasury has distorted the relationship between the economic value of DXdao and DXD.\n\nSimultaneously, the long-term prospects of DXD and DXdao are strong, with a well-funded treasury and an emerging, diversified product suite. DXdao is set to launch an OMN token with Omen Guild governance capabilities, Swapr is rolling out on multiple chains and Mesa prepares for a v2 relaunch. DXD is positioned to rise in value over the coming years as these products and DXdao’s assets generate cash flow.\n\nThe community has debated [the prospects of a DXD buyback](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-program-signal-proposal/2826) for several months on calls, Keybase/Discord and in [the forum](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-using-eth-from-the-treasury/2503). The community has reached soft consensus to move forward with the buyback program as a way to acquire an undervalued asset and reward DXD holders for the rise in the value of the treasury. This process can be carried out on Mainnet or xDai. In the future, DXdao may use a different relayer and on-chain method to complete the purchase. \n\n### Details\n\nThe community has been working to enact the buyback program in a decentralized and transparent manner. Voting FOR this proposal signals support for the creation of the DXD buyback program as outlined below and in the supporting documents.\n\nThis [announcement](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRDwuJ8HovZbEW7y9iQeqM5GT7dciCVnRYPCsX2LKqBAA) lays out the conditions of the program. To briefly summarize, DXdao is committed to purchasing up to $1m of DXD on the open market as long as the book value of the ETH and stablecoins in the [treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) is larger than DXD’s outstanding circulating supply. These trades will be executed at a price that is 2.5% above DXD/ETH TWAP price at time of execution and will not exceed 25% of average trading volume.\n\nTrades will use a Gnosis Protocol Relayer Contract (“GP Relayer”) deployed by the community to complete the trades. Each trade requires two proposals. One to send the ETH funds to the GP Relayer, and then a second proposal to set the order using the funds in the relayer at the price determined by the specified oracle. This [technical explainer](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmdc477sHnuBomCHGLp4aBxABTTBkgJrCTZs95ceZvEmpd) goes into greater detail on how the GP Relayer works.\n\n### Risks and Other Considerations\n\nThis is the first time that DXdao is considering purchasing DXD on the open market. It’s also the first time DXdao has used the GP Relayer on Mainnet. It has been [audited](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdCvSMRkKWxJmdLZVu7REJa67LGFoPchuMeUYVMNYosn6) and tested on xDai. There are additional risks given that this is a market trade that relies on an on-chain action.\n\nThis buyback program represents new ground for DAOs and DXdao intends to be as transparent as possible.

I've added the possibility of sending any claimed reward to a different recipient than the claimer, of claiming only part of the reward or the reward in its entirety, and of recovering any funds directly sent to the contract (the funds will always be recovered by the distribution's owner), which were previously stuck in limbo. On the UI, we've reached a point where it's testable, with working staking/withdrawing and claiming on Rinkeby. I've also integrated the dapp with the updated subgraph in order to quickly fetch the data needed to be shown in the new and improved UI. The work done can be easily checked in [this draft PR](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/180) on the dapp, and by looking at the [commits in the contracts repo](https://github.com/luzzif/erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts/commits/master).\n\n- Generalized the whole platform (with work mainly focused on dapp and SDK) to be easily ran even on chains that don't have ETH as the native currency. The dapp/SDK have been updated to support multiple chains with potentially exotic native assets rather quickly. All of the logics that used ETH explicitly have been generalized. The process has also lead to the deployment of test instances of Swapr (contracts included, even though not official) on xDai and Sokol. Proof [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/185) (dapp) and [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-sdk/pull/28) (SDK).\n\n- Following the same logic, the same work has been done on the subgraph too, which now supports data indexing on multiple chains (in particular mainnet, Rinkeby and xDai) and fully supports farming-related data indexing from the contracts. The proof is in this PR [right here](https://github.com/nicoelzer/swapr-subgraph/pull/1).\n\n- Heavily helped initializing and finalizing the \"smart routing\" feature (work has been done by `seibelj` too), which checks prices for any given trade among different platforms and performs the transaction at the best price with no additional gas cost, even if on other dexes. The feature supports  platforms on multiple chains/networks, and in particular Uniswap/Sushiswap on mainnet/Rinkeby and Honeyswap on xDai. Proof [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/188) as far as the dapp is concerned, and [here](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-sdk/pull/31) for the SDK.\n\n- Updated DXstats to fetch Swapr data on multiple chains in the same UI, with reference chain switchable through a dedicated dropdown. Still not perfect, but great progress. Proof and preview accessible [here](https://github.com/nicoelzer/dxstats/pull/6).\n","title":"DAI payout (26/01-26/02) - luzzifoss ","hash":"QmQ1MHTy6YA78ANHskyrUEFAHQGTNqcWitKUF8RXeeJ9cg"},"0xc37b52c960f02d9ecc0c1f0438152741fea2e990bc0dfc56d32f9a9118372416":{"description":"## Timeframe\nFrom 26/07/2021 to 25/09/2021, two full months.\n\n## Responsibilities\nWill try to lead development on Swapr, which will remain the main focus at least on the first month, but will then try to switch to Carrot development (lead role in that) in the second month.

This proposal extends the role as a contributor into September and October.\n\nI plan to focus about half my time on the DXbiz Squad revolving around business development opportunities, introduction of opportunities for DXdao and originating and growing DXdao awareness and product awareness while contributing half my time to other initiatives as well. I will also focus on driving initiatives forward that I think are important for DXdao, even if they sit outside of my main focus.\n\nI estimate my contribution focus to be 50% DXbiz, 10% DXvoice, 10% Governance, 10% DXventures, 20% Other/ContributorX/Product/Testing/Strategy.\n\nWhat I plan to focus on and be responsible for:\n\n**DXbiz:** I have ongoing responsibilities as the DXbiz Squad leader, which can be seen regularly in past proposals, mainly being the coordination of DXdao’s opportunities while acting as a main internal point of contact for all things related to these opportunities. I also represent DXdao and its ecosystem at many Ethereum events and in relationships with other DAOs, funds, projects, and partners. Other related responsibilities include:\n\n- Coordinate the organization of and tracking of DXbiz opportunities. Checking in with points of contact and status for each opportunity\n- Focus on opportunities connecting DXdao and it’s products to other communities\n- Provide knowledge to Squads on the related product landscapes and strategies to take\n- Initiating, building and maintaining relationships and discussions on behalf of DXdao with external parties in the ecosystem\n- Partnerships: Develop, grow and filter partnership opportunities for DXdao\n- Bring new ideas from outside learnings to help DXdao expand its strategies across different areas.\n- Develop, write and publish more articles about the unique and important things DXdao is leading with (creating thought leadership articles)\n- Deliver reports of actions taken and opportunity progress to the DXdao community\n- Deliver the ongoing implementation of the weekly DXbiz Huddle (and channel) where we strategize and prioritize ongoing and future opportunities.\n- Coordinating with the product teams of DXgov, Swapr and Carrot around DXbiz opportunities in order to support the ongoing goals and grow awareness of each.\n\nAs DXdao and its products mature and evolve, we will seek out new, larger opportunities that weren’t possible previously. This will hopefully lead to some significant achievements for DXdao.\n\nI plan to be a large part of DXdao’s presence in Colombia during Devcon week and surrounding days in what is a very strategic period for DXdao. This will include DXdao’s Infinite Hackathon, The DAOist Bogota, Schelling Point, and Devcon itself.\n\nThe DXdao Retreat is also VERY important for DXdao’s future. I plan to prepare a detailed report with the “Review and Moving Forward Outlook” for the DXbiz Squad.\n\nI also have a goal to improve communication channels and open feedback loop between the DXbiz Squad and:\n\n- DXdao Squads\n- DXdao community\n- Wider DAO community\n- Wider Ethereum community\n\nThe DXbiz Squad plans to clearly communicate the highlights and recaps from the past and also outline the goals moving forward. There will be an open chance for the community to provide input and ideas around the direction.\n\nI also plan to help prepare the necessary materials for the other DX Squads I contribute to.\n\n**DXvoice:** I am also a core member of the DXvoice squad, where I participate and support many of the initiatives around community, recruiting, marketing, writing articles, event, merch, design input, representing DXdao for media opportunities and at events.\n\n**Governance:** Leading by example, I will continue to be a highly active governance participant in DXdao, including on-chain actions (review, staking, voting) and the processes and discussions that allow DXdao to remain secure and effective, proper treasury management, open discussions, and standing up for core values. I aim to bring extra initiative to the governance processes. I also aim to push forward the future of DXdao governance by liaising with the DXgov Squad. One of the key values I can bring is being aware of the needs of DXdao and other DAOs.\n\n**DXventures:** I think DXventures has a larger spot in the future of DXdao. I have ongoing responsibilities as the organizer of DXventures, including filtering, presenting, organizing and driving the DXventures opportunities that DXdao has. Completing the tasks to bring the most important opportunities to completion.\n\nDXventures opportunities have slowed recently for a number of reasons but I think this initiative should have more focus. With the creation of the “Incubation Grant” we developed for Nimi, I think this model could be explored with more ideas, teams and projects. I think DXdao needs to figure out ways to “Expand the Opportunity Field’'.\n\nThere are ways for more opportunities to come through the DXdao ecosystem. I would say this strategy falls into the exploration and research area of DXdao. I think that every contributor to DXdao, and also community members, should have an opportunity to spend time exploring, researching and bringing new ideas to DXdao. Up until now, this is not something that has been a part of most contributor’s mandates, but I think it should be. I will plan to propose some ideas and a framework around this.\n\n**Other/ContributorX/Product/Testing/Strategy:** I include this category to account for all other value I plan to contribute to DXdao as a core contributor. This includes actions towards Contributor Experience, product usage, testing reporting and improvements, strategy around DXdao’s products and initiatives, helping to improve Swapr and its usage, health and awareness. I will also be spending time helping to organize and coordinate the events that DXdao participates in.\n\n**Swapr Growth Cross-Squad:** We are starting a Swapr Growth cross-squad. With better user statistics and more focused prioritization and strategy, we plan to set and seek goals for Swapr, adjusting live as we go forward.\n\n**Infinite Hackathon**: I plan to increase attention paid towards Infinite Hackathon as we near the event. It is now go-time and focus and communication are key to execution.\n\n**DXD Token WG**: I will aim to participate and add value to the DXD Token Working Group.\n\n**Carrot v1:** I am prepared to focus more on the promotion of Carrot as v1 comes alive. I have been actively exploring and inquiring around the potential for a Carrot Campaign in Bogota.\n\n**Regarding DXdao’s plans for moving forward:**\nI have a few important goals I would like to explore bringing into the plan:\n- Bring better facilitation into the DXdao ecosystem. It may be very valuable to have a 3rd party coach/facilitator, who has deep knowledge of the space and can also learn the intricacies of DXdao, participate in DXdao coordination.\n- Strengthen the understanding of interdependence between Squads within DXdao. No individual squad can succeed on its own. Each squad relies on each other for survival and success.\n- If and when strategies are determined, I will work towards implementation and achieving the goals.\n\n**Proposal Summary:**\n\nI am identifying as a Level 8 contributor, and will be applying a 85% of full commitment percentage for September 2022 (I was off the first couple days of September) and 85% of full commitment for October 2022 due to participation in outside commitments, personal matters, travel and conferences.\n\n**Summary of compensation would be:**\n\n- 7,650 xDAI (9,000 x 85% plus 9,000 x 85% = 15,300) to be paid when the proposal gets approved and the balance (7,650 xDAI) on 10/31/2022 when the contribution agreement finishes.\n- Approval for: 16,150 USD (9,500 x 85% plus 9,500 x 85% = 16,150) to be paid in DXD in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff when the contribution agreement finishes.

This proposal places an order for 11.72 WETH using a [$2860.49 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was originally passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45), and extended for another $1m to $3m total, through a further proposal which also passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x56c66f99d87a48d707475aa2466f0a58da13bd744475410957d6572b439cc5bf). The extension on the buyback program was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/extend-dxd-buyback-program-for-another-1m-draft-proposal/3319). \n\nThis proposal would place a limit order on the Gnosis Protocol at a price that is 3% above the time-weighted average price of xDXD/WETH on Swapr when the proposal is executed and the [Oracle contract is called](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xFbAc9467FCcb14394860A9E280E2FBabCBbc8DD2/transactions).

I will continue to support efforts for the OMN token launch with further specification to token distribution regarding airdrops, written documentation on OMN governance / liquidity rewards, set-up some PR opportunities with possible speaking engagements on Omen, and partnerships for other liquidity mining campaigns on Omen.\n\nHeld approximately 7-10 meetings with contributors regarding company formation and tax issues. This is still an ongoing process with more meetings to come. Specifically, I need to set up meetings with local attorneys for contributors in Portugal, Sweden, and Italy. I’m hoping that in the coming work period (first month) most of these issues will be addressed or close to being resolved.\n\nRetained law firm Polsinelli, PC to answer DXdao’s general legal questions. I will be reaching out to them with specific feedback on our compliance program.\n\nCompleted buyback transparency documentation with @powers and @fluiddrop. Also, assisted @JohnKelleher with edits for the DXD Token Model post.\n\nDrafted a terms sheet, forum post, and onchain proposal with a Grant Investment Agreement, and redlined a Grant Notice for DXdao’s first DXventures investment in Opolis. Coordinated this mostly with @sky, who has been good to work with on this.I’m also working with some solutions for DAO-related investments that may require blockchain analysis.\n\nI had hoped to contribute to DXVote, but had no time. I Hope to add feedback on DXvote in the future because I think it’s a cool initiative.\n\nAssisted with Contributor UX objectives – supported @Melanie’s efforts to create documentation on contributor onboarding, offboarding, and performance check-ins. Also, started the process of working with @blackscale on the new payroll system parameters, which he is taking over from Block Rocket.\n\nHeld SWPR token kick-off meeting with @Zett to go over a basic roadmap for next steps.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nExperience Level: 5\n\nFor the past two worker proposals (3 months) I was at level 4 compensation. The logic was that my partner and I believed our experience placed us at a level 5, but we first wanted to prove value at Level 4. This work period, I intend to move up to level 5 given my expanding responsibilities and past experience.\n\nFull-time for total of 40 hours per week, for two months (3.12.21 - 5.12.21):\n\n$16,000 (DAI) 50% to be paid once the proposal gets approved and 50% on or after 5/12/2021 when the work agreement finishes.\n$12,000 (DXD). $6,000 (DXD) vested at 1 year, and $5,000 (DXD) vested after the first year on a linear schedule.\n0.3334% REP\nI joined DXdao as a part-time contributor as of 12/12/20. Prior to this, I, along with my partner under @pulpmachina, contributed for two (2) months through DAOtalk topic posts, meeting participation, and Keybase / Telegram discussions. See our list of posts here.\n\nIn case of any change in the compensation guidelines during this work period, the amounts of the compensation in this proposal will be adjusted to match the latest one from the agreed worker compensation guidelines. \n\nThis is a request for the second half of my compensation for the contract period.\n","title":"Tammy Worker Payout Proposal: Second Half of 3.12.21 - 5.12.21","hash":"QmdXugyHaWS27poFKnBestvL4xoy2wuEQoa82c16fXKU6e"},"0xc58b90c2a39b1ca145208618ca8a3b5cc5627edf43ea7a9c4d154062f37ab1c9":{"description":"This proposal deposits funds to Swapr Liquidity Relayer.\n\nThis proposal will transfer 0.94 WBTC to the relayer. \n\nThe Swapr relayer will provision the funds as liquidity on Swapr as outlined in this post: https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-authorize-and-fund-xdai-base/2651/7\n","title":"Depositing WBTC in Swapr Liquidity Relayer","hash":"QmUUHsDZoPGCi8ucxJhd9XPycPChfJSvtU7LsNeS7RCahy"},"0xc5a52914d01740ac88b8858716bf71d50fd0f3d20b894ee9839894a2db1fbdf2":{"description":"This proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

I’ve been following DXdao for some time, and I have a lot of ideas for how I can contribute to the Marketing efforts here, specifically to Omen. I was formally introduced to the community by @JohnKelleher and have talked with @KeenanL about projects to work on during my trial period. I also discussed my contribution plan with the Marketing and Communications team as a whole on the most recent call.\n\nI’ve been a user of various online prediction markets, and I understand the pain points the online prediction markets community struggles with. Omen provides excellent relief from the problems associated with the most popular online prediction market, Predictlt. Omen has significantly lower fees, no betting limits, and is decentralized. But despite Omen’s numerous benefits, the platform suffers from few users and low liquidity. My primary focus will be on closing this communication gap and allowing Omen to realize the full potential of its underlying technology! In the next 2.5 months my goals are to start and execute on the following initiatives:\n\nAcquire users for Omen\nIncrease awareness of Omen within the online betting community\nProvide marketing and writing support for a variety of projects\nTime-frame:\n\nTrial Period: 17th May 2021 - 27th May 2021\n\n27th May 2021 - 31st July 2021 (contingent on the trial period)\n\nResponsibilities\n\nConduct marketing and build awareness for Omen across a variety of channels including online prediction markets-related Telegram chats, Discord servers, and the comments section on PredictIt\nWrite Tweets for DXdao and Omen\nAssist with a variety of projects where I can apply my marketing and writing expertise such as the DXdao rebranding, updating the copy on the DXdao landing page, and any other projects that may arise\nDeliverables\n\nMarketing page comparing the differences between PredictIt and Omen (this is a very favorable comparison for Omen)\nGuide to Omen for users who’ve bet on PredictIt or another online prediction market before, but are new to Omen\nGuide to Omen for users who are completely new to betting on prediction markets\nThe marketing page and guides I create will be essential for Omen to acquire additional users and realize the full potential of the platform. I will also use the comments section of PredictIt to inform PredictIt users about the low-fee alternative of Omen.

Following a loss of key developers, the DAO had decided to put Aqua and Omen on hiatus, and so the Aqua team was then focused on placing the project in a state that we could easily return to in the future. I then decided to join the Gov development team. The project was originally just a solo project by @AugustoL to replace and expand upon the old DaoStack governance portal. The development team is currently made up of @ross, @AugustoL, @madusha, @luchux, and I. We have a roadmap set up of which we are currently focused on improving the UI/UX of dxvote. \n\n\nWhat I did well:\n* I'm proud of reworking the way that the call data appears. Many members were requesting that the call data be human-readable.\n* Ended up having to fork and [upgrade the gnosis proxy contract kit](https://github.com/hhamud/contract-proxy-kit) myself to allow for wrapping of native tokens and using it in a sale in a single batched transaction via the frontend. This allowed users to also share the same proxy contract if they had already used one when they interacted with an Omen market. \n* While this has nothing to do with dev work, I have gotten to know the non-contributor community better on discord. *Grinding those XPs*\n\nWhat I should improve on:\n* Transitioning took a bit longer than it should have. Understanding the codebase was difficult, so there is defo room to improve there.\n\n\n\n\nWork Completed here:\n\nAqua FrontEnd\n\n* [Pull Requests](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+assignee%3Ahhamud+)\n* [Issues](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/issues?q=is%3Aissue+assignee%3Ahhamud)\n\nDxVote:\n* [Pull Requests](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pulls?q=+is%3Apr+assignee%3Ahhamud+)\n* [Issues](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+assignee%3Ahhamud+)\n\n\n\n\nCompensation:\n\nExperience Level: 2\n\nTime commitment: Full-time\n\n$10000 DAI: For 2 months of work at level 2, to be sent half on the first payment proposal and half on the second payment proposal\n\n$6000 DXD: Vested for 2 years starting on 25/10/2021\n\n0.3334% REP: for 2 months of work, to be sent half on the first payment proposal and half on the second payment proposal\n\nWork Experience:\n\n* [[DRAFT] Levotiate Contributor Proposal 23/04/2021 to 23/06/2021](https://daotalk.org/t/draft-levotiate-contributor-proposal-23-04-2021-to-23-06-2021/3089)\n* [Developer Proposal: 23/04/2021 - 23/06/2021](https://daotalk.org/t/developer-proposal-23-04-2021-23-06-2021/2864)\n* https://daotalk.org/t/developer-proposal\n* https://daotalk.org/t/developer-proposal-first-two-months\n* https://daotalk.org/t/developer-proposal-second-half-of-the-first-two-months","title":"Levotiate Contributor Proposal 25/08/2021 to 25/10/2021: Second Half","hash":"QmaZgD2i8fnNYUD2rMWgMQ7Zt9vNCR5VU7UE4m76LPm6XA"},"0xc7c242ee6854995f9743748eb8aab8c00e2b0f800d24b34e7bfc50cb29561793":{"description":"This signal proposal aims to reach consensus on the Q3 REP Boost proposal, found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-discord-rep-boosts-q3-2021/3374).

Here is a brief overview of the post:\n\n> ## Background\nWelcome to Q3! Since Q1 of 2021, I’ve organized a quarterly REP boost that targets community activity and retention. After a successful 1st, and of course 2nd period, we are back once again for a third Discord REP boost. This will need to pass through governance, since there have been some additional Discord role changes that alter the effectiveness/attainability of each level. This largely includes the removal of level 1, and reductions to the lower and upper bounds. Here is some context from the original proposal:\n\n>```With the introduction of the DXdao Discord server, @KeenanLuke has proposed an initiative to get more community members involved in Governance. A governance gateway drug, if you will. This functions as a quarterly allocation; a way for us to leave the door open to those most active in the community to further involvement with DXdao and its governance.```\n\n>In its current configuration, the DXdao Discord server tracks a user’s participation in the preceding quarter and assigns a role based on quantity and quality of the engagement.\n\n>## Eligibility\nThe below list contains all users eligible for a boost, their respective level, and the allocation of mainnet REP they are entitled to receive. Active DXdao contributors are not eligible for this initiative, and have been removed from the list. Anyone nominated for a traditional community REP boost is still eligible for this initiative, since high levels are difficult to obtain and the REP is distributed quarterly instead of monthly.\n\n>Although the entitlement is in mainnet REP, it is highly advised that community members request their REP via xDXdao - where governance contract interaction is a fraction of a cent. Anyone is welcome to reach out to @KeenanLuke, or any other community member involved with governance, requesting a small amount of xDai to make their REP request proposal and start voting!\n\n>If no concerns have arisen within a few days of this post being live, @KeenanLuke will create a signal proposal on xDai to update this initiative. If the proposal passes, @KeenanLuke will notify those who are eligible and assist in the claiming process by updating the “DXdao Discord REP Boost Guide 1”. A dedicated channel for the Discord REP boosts will be opened in the Governance category of the DXdao Discord, where eligible participants will be notified.\n\nSuccessful passage of this proposal greenlights eligible Discord participants to their respective mainnet REP allocation, to be claimed VIA xDAI.","title":"Signal Proposal for DXdao Discord REP Boosts Q3 2021","hash":"QmWVHkosqs1ULQ2fP1RYpMdm7JciMnLFBfzqbGsYy1FmMM"},"0xc7cf52f547b343d75c5c6c55238abf6e28702858e7dcbab7e16c113a99e8a816":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

This is to be paid in two installments: one as soon as possible for the reservation purposes and the second 10 days before the event.\n\nThis cost includes accommodation and breakfast for 22 contributors and 3 facilitators from Lateral for 5 nights, transportation to and from the location from Cartagena and exclusive use of the accommodations. The accommodations will be closed just for DXdao, for the first 4 nights.\n\nFor the food & beverages, it will be à la carte, so it will depend on the actual consumptions, but we estimate about 5,900 USD total for the 5 days.\n\nFor other activities, this will depend on a more detailed design of the retreat and exploration of possibilities. However, we have already completed preliminary research and estimate 5,000 USD to cover these additional costs.\n\nIn total this proposal is requesting 108034107.66 COP or 25,000 USD.\n\n**Funds**\n\nThis proposal sends a total of $25K USD to the DXdao MS wallet - from which funds can be drawn gradually to cover costs.

For example, I am leading the push for strategies to leverage DXdao’s capital to improve Swapr’s positioning in the multichain DEX space and have also taken the initiative to organize a DXdao event during ETHDenver week.\n\nI estimate my contribution focus to be 55% DXbiz, 10% DXventures, 10% DXvoice, 10% Governance, 15% Other/ContributorX/Product/Testing/Strategy.\n\nWhat I plan to focus on and be responsible for:\n\n**DXbiz:** I have ongoing responsibilities as the DXbiz Squad leader, which can be seen regularly in past proposals, mainly being the coordination of DXdao’s opportunities while acting as a main internal point of contact for all things related to these opportunities. I also represent DXdao and its ecosystem at Ethereum events and in relationships with other DAOs, funds, projects, and partners. Other related responsibilities include:\n\n* Coordinate the organization of and tracking of DXbiz opportunities. Checking in with points of contact and status for each opportunity\n* Focus on opportunities connecting DXdao and it’s products to other communities\n* Provide knowledge to Squads on the related product landscapes and strategies to take\n* Initiating, building and maintaining relationships and discussions on behalf of DXdao with external parties in the ecosystem\n* Partnerships: Develop, grow and filter partnership opportunities for DXdao\n* Bring new ideas from outside learnings to help DXdao expand its strategies across different areas.\n* Develop, write and publish more articles about the unique and important things DXdao is leading with (creating thought leadership articles)\n* Deliver reports of actions taken and opportunity progress to the DXdao community\n* Deliver the ongoing implementation of the weekly DXbiz Huddle (and channel) where we strategize and prioritize ongoing and future opportunities.\n* Coordinating with the product teams of DXgov, Swapr and Carrot around DXbiz opportunities in order to support the ongoing goals and grow awareness of each.\n* Create and present the DXbiz review and 2022 outlook & strategy\n\n**DXventures:** I have ongoing responsibilities as the default organizer of DXventures, including filtering, presenting, organizing and driving the opportunities that DXdao has. Completing the tasks to bring the most important opportunities to completion.\n\n**DXvoice:** I am also a core member of the DXvoice squad, where I participate and support many of the initiatives around community, recruiting, marketing, writing articles, DXdao’s [video content](https://www.youtube.com/c/dxdao), event, merch, design input, representing DXdao for media opportunities and at events. I aim to expand the experimentation and initiatives that DXvoice is pursuing with new ideas like InitiativeDAO.\n\n**Governance:** Leading by example, I will continue to be a highly active governance participant in DXdao, including on-chain actions (review, staking, voting) and the processes and discussions that allow DXdao to remain secure and effective, proper treasury management, open discussions, and standing up for core values. I aim to bring extra initiative to the governance processes. I also aim to push forward the future of DXdao governance by liaising with the DXgov Squad.\n\n**Other/ContributorX/Product/Testing/Strategy:** I include this category to account for all other value I plan to contribute to DXdao as a core contributor.

In the original design, revenue from DXdao products - in the form of ETH - would be deposited into the bonding curve contract. At any time, DXD could be deposited into the bonding curve contract in exchange for ETH. The price at which the bonding curve “buys” DXD is determined by the amount of ETH in the buyback reserve of the bonding curve contract. In this design, revenue from products would support the market price of ETH.\n\nThis is not how things played out. The bonding curve was very successful at launching DXD and providing DXdao the resources to build products, but it has not been a successful value accrual method for DXD. \n\nInstead, DXdao [enacted a buyback program in May of 2021](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to purchase DXD off the open market as it was trading significantly below the NAV of the treasury. So far, [14,500 DXD has been purchased](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing), which is more than 30% of the DXD that was minted from the bonding curve. With the buyback reserve depleting, a [scaled-down program](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/mainnet/proposal/0x072519e7fa7d55619fcc675c5c47e446e499ee454da1f2b370825ac447d06758) using funds from the general treasury is being weighed by the community.\n\nThe buyback program has driven value to DXD, but it is not a sustainable model - it is capital inefficient, requires manual submission and does not scale to other forms of non-ETH revenue. This has [long been discussed in the community](https://daotalk.org/t/discussion-on-the-long-term-future-of-the-dxd-buyback-program-the-dxd-token-model/3860) with differing opinions on how to move forward, but the discussion lacks the rigor and analysis needed to find consensus.\n\nA dedicated DXD Token Working Group (WG) would give this issue the attention it deserves with the goal of finding a sustainable model that can then be built and implemented. The overall process should be similar to the [Governance 2.0 Working Group](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x89219ab40e29bacd3fd96d58880878d83d67b155aaf8f82a74aae8d167d996bc), which took place 18 months ago. The [Gov 2.0 WG](https://daotalk.org/t/governance-2-0-signal-proposal/2600) consisted of full-time DXdao contributors, engaged REP and DXD holders, and other DeFi and DAO groups (Delphi Digital, DAOstack).\n\n### Details\n\nThis proposals initiates the DXD Token Working Group and also serves as an open invitation to the DXdao community for feedback and suggestions on DXD's future. The WG will take the form of calls, forum discussions, research & modeling, and ultimately another on-chain proposal to ratify its findings.\n\n### Scope of WG:\n\nIdentify shortcomings in bonding curve and buyback models and present solution(s) that address these and create a long-term sustainable value accrual method for DXD.\n\nDXdao governance needs to approve a new DXD token model accomplishes these goals:\n\n1. Translates revenue/profit/assets of DXdao into DXD\n\n2. Can be staked to participate in governance\n\n3. Clearly communicated and attractive to new token holders\n\nPerhaps the solution should also address a multichain world. The WG might also consider the overall liquidity of DXD and DXdao-provided liquidity.\n\n### Participants:\n\nAll members of the DXdao community are invited to participate. DXdao contributors that are active participants in governance are expected to follow along and provide feedback. DXD holders (@hughesconnor , @0xSpicySoup , @hedgedhog )are especially encouraged to be actively involved and the WG should make an effort to actively seek out their input.\n\nA new DXD Token Model will affect all corners of DXdao. DXdao contributors plan to be key members of the WG as it relates to their product (@0xVenky, @ross) or squad (@KeenanL ). \n\nAnyone in or outside the DXdao community interested in participating, please reach out to @Powers \n\n### Output:\n\nA specification document, signed off by DXD Token WG, that provides solutions that can be executed on by the DXdao community. It will be up to the WG to decide if the final document includes a single-agreed-upon plan or one that can be voted on by DXdao governance.\n\n### Resources:\n\n* The WG will take up a considerable amount of Governance squad resources over the three month period. Estimated to be 20% of squad time\n* WG participants can earn mainnet REP for their contributions (if not receiving REP as a contributor)\n* Outside research may enhance WG’s understanding and may require paid consultation. WG may request up to $10,000 in for research or model building.\n\n### Schedule & Timeline:\n\nThe WG will need to report back its findings as well as provide updates during the process. Currently proposing bi-weekly calls on Thursday at 16:30 UTC.

I am deeply grateful to be a part of such a ground-breaking organization.

We now have the majority of major features complete with just a few final additions.\n* **Smart contract development** - With the help of @AugustoL we now have most of the team actively contributing to smart contract development. Improving processes and reliance on one developer as well as being on track to get dxvote and guilds contracts away for audit. Still a way to go but an amazing start.\n* **Reflecting & improving** - Coming out of Denver we had a lot of recent changes in contributors to the team I don't think I was working very effectively, feeling a little overwhelmed and scatterbrained. With the help of the entire team, we had incredibly constructive retrospectives on how we work with great suggestions around the availability of information, sprints, discussions and more. After taking time to focus on how to fix this and chatting with other Project managers (thanks @Zett and @0xVenky) I think I have come out more able to manage DXgov and the team has been doing a great job.\n* **DXgov features** - There have been some features I had thought out quite some time ago for DXgov’s products that could help set it apart from the competition and the iteration and execution of these with the team have been super exciting to see. I really can't wait to demo all of these to you shortly.\n  * **Proposal creation UX** - The first was an expansion of the ENS ownership idea to more configurations, the main one being a rich data configuration for contracts meaning that we can provide a far greater user experience for people creating proposals than is possible with just the solidity data as a lot of expertise goes into understanding and creating proposals.\n  * **Social layer** - The next is the social layer of governance that has been long dreamed of by many in DXdao and with the recent recruitment of @CarlB who came to us via Denver’s hackathon it is coming soon. A lot of thought, prototyping and design have been put into this coming feature to make it more than just a forum whilst being as decentralised but usable as possible.\n\n* **Tech planning** - The suggestion (I believe from Kenny) to run tech planning sessions was an excellent one and we have had many successful sessions that helped iterate on ideas and spread awareness of future plans. With this way of working we have also started planning in more detail the next step of the roadmap, refactoring. Miro board - https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOFSd4aY=/ github discussions - https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/discussions\n* **DXDenver** - I think at each conference I get better and better at this and this was no exception. It's always great fun introducing people to DXdao that have no real concept of what real decentralisation actually looks like and what it can do. The hackathon being a huge success and having people come and ask questions on top of what we have built was also super exciting.\n\n**Did ok:**\n\n* **Public speaking** - I did my first public speaking event in Denver on a panel with @Powers and @AugustoL on governance 2.0. I was pretty nervous but thankful to be on a stage with two veterans. We were pretty rushed for time and I was underprepared but I am excited to doing more things like this and improving over time. I was also on a panel for swarm’s online hackathon speaking about governance with some of the most well known early people to the DAO space including Matan, Griff Green and more. Most of the topics went very philosophical but it was a fun experience.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naMLVHK9hp0&t=4155s\n\n* **DXloan idea** - Not made public anywhere but I was working on a proposal for an under collateralized loan for contributors using REP and vested DXD. This is something we have talked about previously but never really moved much with due to it being quite difficult. For now, I think I’m putting it on hold for a variety of reasons but it was a good experience building a proposal and getting great feedback on it.\n\n**Could have done better:**\n\n* **Transparency** - So far guilds have still very much been under wrap with the extent of what others see being the designs at most. Of course, being fully transparent isn't super simple when the product is being built from the ground up but I think it's around the time now when we should be getting more feedback, especially as the UI will be reused for DXvote.\n* **Onboarding** - Although our two new developers, @CarlB and @vangrim, have been doing an incredibly good job I don't think I can take much credit for it. Partially bad timing with EthDenver as well as me just being a little distracted and unprepared for onboarding more people. There is a lot more I can do to better prepare for future onboarding (although we should be good resource wise for a while).\n\n**2nd month:**\n$8000 DAI\n$6000 DXD\n0.1667% REP\n\nBEGIN KEYBASE SALTPACK SIGNED MESSAGE. kXR7VktZdyH7rvq v5weRa0zkLTK50O n6efJRAsAf1W1Na LbaPFnWlIPPTjIS 2VR42d9ihBGGGUp Tr3RKrkvUdTpml8 1iZZMLvuWfiLWxr RjWWiGHGObjHnHz gCGyxy27qpgEYsi EBVwnlkZAtQSzVY 8dAaWZskt8ZHnoO vrq279lNEWrO2QF GWTfYgtYWAVXbjg KAT1YKsKa7DVbzW jOpqxR3trTuXgIZ mnjYP4w7ziPKvXV HlEgQ0qM0ZBpgdG uRQ.

Working at DXDAO makes contributors not only better in the technical field or DeFi experts, but also better people who work on themselves in every field and \"fight\" with themselves to achieve the same goal of decentralization.\nAfter the successful completion of the Trial Period, I decided and received confirmation from community members and the team that I should attend the EthCC in Paris and I am very happy because I will meet and get even closer with others from the community and improve my knowledge.\n \n\n\n\n**Could be better:**\n\nSince I was focused on contributing to Swapr as soon as possible and \"serving a purpose\" as a QA contributor as much as I can for this trial period I haven't had that much time to learn and get to know more about DXDAO in general and other projects mentioned in the weekly meetings, so my goal is to improve to benefit the community and beyond the Swapr project but to continue to contribute to Swapr as needed and more.\n\nAs for the technical side, I noticed that I'm weaker with the DevOps stuff that a QA contributor needs.

Thats why, Swapr was built to be no user analytics, zero fee decentralised frontend for all AMMs and a vision to be the go-to platform for users seeking a secure, private and fully decentralised dapp that offers access to the best possible routes across various dexes and networks.\n\n### Mission\n\n*Our mission is to build a user-friendly, feature-rich and intuitive dapp that prioritises decentralisation, privacy, and security, making it easy for anyone to access and participate in the world of decentralised exchange and liquidity provision.\n*\n\n## Overall Guild Milestones and goals\n\nThe guild will aim to increase the usage of Swapr\n-   By integrating more networks,\n-   Integrating more aggregators\n-   By integrating more dexes\n-   Have a pivot for Swapr and remove all the other tangential or less used features.\n-   Unifying the swap experience\n-   Release LP Zapping.\n\nThe guild will also work closely with “Voice” guild and “Operations” guild to find the value of what is being built and delivered and for timely onboarding of resources. Swapr squad is in a state of transition for this half year with some key members undergoing reduction in the time availability for Swapr.\n\nSome features that the squad will continue to develop:\n\n* Token list picker 2.0\n* Expeditions\n* Advanced trading mode\n* Charts\n* Limit orders / conditional orders\n\nSwapr squad, along with caneyfork and the Voice guild will look at expanding the SWPR governance ecosystem and research into ways how to drive value to SWPR token.\n\n## Budget summary\n\nThis proposal approves the following future expenses as summarized below and further detailed in the accompanying spreadsheet.\n\n[Budget spreadsheet link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LK4DFC2BnsNYONQIH91F_4AhJ7kKSfciUZfrX0qAZVI/edit#gid=0)\n\nThe 3 month budget for Swapr is not a 50% of the 6 month budget as there is a lot of resource reduction from February. The budget spreadsheet is updated with all the calculation and kindly reach out to me if you have any questions.\n\nAnd a comparison to a year ago looks like below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/85jNeDQ.png)\n\n\n## Squad Metrics\n\nFrom the previous proposal, Swapr has identified a reluctance in being aggressive with the expansion. So, instead this is a mellowed expansion where we will try to have one priority list for Swapr.\n\nThe goals and OKRs are for the upcoming 6 months and are aimed at increasing the amount of users using Swapr. We will aim to go about this by expanding to new networks, aggregators and dexes. We will also bring the focus of the dapp to one thing and one thing only, making swaps easier. All the less used features will be removed from the dapp and will be spin out as a separate product. We also aim for Swapr to find its own revenue source and not depend primarily on the protocol fees. \n\n\n**Key Milestones and Goals**:\n-   Unify Swapbox and improve swap experience\n-   Reduce the clutter and remove less used features.\n-   Maintain and improve the current featureset.\n-   Extend to new networks, dexes, aggregators and bridge integrations\n-   Find revenue generating sources for Swapr dapp through grants / fee share with aggregators.\n-   Remove irrelevant features that are not a \"swap\" feature away from Swapr. \n-   Research to see if we can seperate out AMM from Swapr and rebrand as a seperate product with minimal updates to existing contracts.\n-   Release zapping as a feature in Swapr. \n-   Investigate if Zapr could be split out as a seperate product if it finds a PMF within Swapr. (If this finds a PMF, a seperate funding proposal would be initiated)\n\n\n**Objectives and Key Results:**\n\n**Objective**\nExpand Swapr presence\n\n**Key Results**\nExpand to 3 new networks\nAdd support for 5 new dexes\nAdd 1inch and 2 more aggregators\nAdd 2 bridge integrations\n\n\n**Objective**\nImprove swap experience\n\n**Key Results**\n16M USD 6 month volume. (current projected volume is 7M USD)\nAtleast 500K volume (?) in 6 different networks\nRetention? How to measure?\n\n---------\n\n## Guild Personnel\n\nIndividual contributor lists, contributor level information per [approved guidelines](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xaa3c6d9953d5510a0f014f946e94f03f07a4e5259718e86f07d41d255917e410), and time commitment as percentage of full time. Swapr is going through a transformation, where a few personnel are only going to be available until Feb and will move on to other products. It would be wise for Swapr to have atleast 1 more full time developer that can take over frontend leadership from Adam. \n\n| Contributor | Level | Time commitment (hrs/ week) | Role description | \n|--|--|--|--|\n| Zett | 7  | 13.33 | Guild facilitator, squad lead for liquidity.eth, UX lead and Product designer (60% till Feb, 20% from March to June)\n|Venky|7|24|Project lead, squad lead for Swapr dapp. Splits time between other squads within Swapr guild.|\n|Adam|7|13.33|Dev lead (60% till Feb, 20% from March to June)|\n|Violet|5|8|Frontend developer (available 60% till Feb)|\n|Leo|4|24|Frontend developer|\n|MilanV|4|16|QA (40% to Swapr guild and 60% to Carrot)|\n|Velu|5|10|Frontend developer|\n|Vance|5|10|Frontend developer|\n|Mirko|5|10|Frontend developer (available 60% till Feb)|\n|**Total**||**134.66**||\n\nWe also request the DAO to release 1M SWPR linearly vested for a year to the guild personnel. A portion of this would also be allocated for Voice, upon successfully leading / directing and completing milestones related to Swapr.\n\n\n## Addendum\n\n[Swapr Guild Budget v3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LK4DFC2BnsNYONQIH91F_4AhJ7kKSfciUZfrX0qAZVI/edit#gid=0)","title":"Approve Swapr H1 budget","hash":"QmVyk26DkyPMNFgZEjRc8EabCDswMeDfLEesfWbBSPoWG9"},"0xd273b24baf14e6aa71247cc5c9453ac8e291ed2641d6362b975ef4adb287ae78":{"description":"Hi, This is Lee ChienHui.\nBackground: I am a full stack developer from Canada.\nI joined DxDAO 1 month ago, and completed my trial period and first month.\nThe main project I will work on is Mesa project as a front-end developer.\n\nTimeframe : 22/03/2021 ~ 21/04/2021, 1 month\n\nGoals: Build Mesa project live on testnet.\n\nResponsibilities : Contribute on Mesa front-end projects with Mesa Team.\n\nExperience Level : I am good at front-end with 7 years of experience so my desired level is lvl 4.\n\nMy experience : Passionate software engineer with over 7 years of experience developing software under web, desktop, and mobile environments.

Will focus on continuing to collaborate with the dxgov team, contributing to the guilds MVP, and supporting dxvote\n\nThe reason I am just now submitting my proposal is due to the fact that only now I have a clear date of when I will be able to commit to a full-time contribution. Before that, this period was mainly time off (denver+transition) and some small contributions.\n\nThe commitment time for this proposal will be based on hours that I will update at the end of the period along with the payment details and proper daily worksheet.\n\n_______\n\n\n## Last period review:\nFor the last two months of the trial period, the main objective continued to be technical onboarding in general, being the main responsibility to contribute to the dxgov team. Everything went pretty well, I think the not-so-good part is related to being part-time and not being able to spend more time on dxdao stuff.\n\n### Went well:\nI consider the amount/nature of tickets/issues I worked on was reasonable in terms of contributing to dxgov team and the learning process for me. I mainly worked on Guilds, I have now more understanding of what we are building, how we are doing it, and the end goal. Contract interaction tasks were a great opportunity to further get familiarized with dxdao contracts. These past months were notable in terms of teamwork, not only to get to know each other but to get used to working together (at least for me), where team communication has been efficient when needed. I feel much more comfortable with the operation of the dao in general, being something completely unknown to me in the previous months. At the end of this period, ethdenver happened, which was an amazing opportunity to meet almost everyone, this event was a relevant factor when making my decision to continue contributing here.\n\n### Could be better:\nBeing part-time is quite limiting in all possible aspects: technical learning, getting involved with the DAO, participating in meetings, being available in the chat, being able to do something more than simply what the issue indicates, etc. Communication was decent but I could not be on a day-to-day basis. That will be something to improve in the next period. It would also be helpful to spend some time doing contract development since at some point could result in a smoother process for FE development. Also would like to spend more time doing code reviews.\n\n### Last period contributions:\n- [PR-509 - Vesting contract interaction modal with redeem action](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/509)\n- [PR-529 - Update nvm version & remove package-lock file](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/529)\n- [PR-534 - Add pagination to proposal fetching](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/534)\n- [PR-545 - Rename xdai to Gnosis chain](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/545)\n- [PR-549 - Add integration tests (Cypress implementation)](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/549)\n- [PR-587 - Fetch/show guild instance config data](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/587)\n- [PR-557 - Guild config data (Closed due swr implementation)](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/557)\n- [PR-604 - Remove proposals context](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/604)\n- [PR-601 - Get voting power data for guilds](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/601)\n- [PR-621 - Show member sidebar](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/621)\n- [PR-641 - Create proposal page](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/641)\n\n_______\n\n## Timeframe:\n2 months.

At every conference I see products improving and evolving, but mostly tech serving other tech. The insdustry is booming, but in a nascent stage and sadly there are not many real retail users for a lack of use cases. Some non-infra protocols, and dapps that don’t serve other crypto businesses, are hoping to attract users that would invest capital, but most users with capital are addresses from 2017, and the poor mass retail have no sizeable money to invest or disposable funds to experiment/risk with new innovative tech, rather expect to farm and dump airdrops. At least the decentralized infra is getting more robust, to lay a foundation for future protocols and dapps that will properly cater to end users. Everything moves fast and devs are too busy building, not much time is given to research, reflecting and planning.\n\nHakcathons are to attract devs, inspire innovation, interoperability. Infinite won the hearts of hackers who loved the welcoming environment that was created for them. Some came back from EthGlobal saying it’s boring with the same sponsors each time, confining their creativity. It took a lot of effort, it weighed heavy on many people, but in the end compared to other hackathons done with 10x more funds, it was a success. It helped with organic marketing, affirming DXdao as an entity in the space, and bonding with peer orgs and their communities. However, if the DAO is cutting on budget, and not looking to hire hackers, organizing a hackathon isn’t an efficient initiative.\n\nThe time during the annual team-building retreat was used wisely. It was intense. It was hard to tackle difficult subjects that affect the whole org, its place in the industry, and everyone contributing to it. Lateral tried to help as much as possible professionally with guided sessions/workshops.\n\nI have personally decided to take an indefinite /very long/ hiatus, not just from DXdao, but the industry as a whole.

I asked SpaceInch to help analyse the opportunity as we don’t have enough dev resource to evaluate and act on, but the DAO has disengaged from SpaceInch.\n- helped get Swarm Association join Infinite Hackathons and Genesis Bogota last minute; happy to have actively contributed to attracting three of the four co-orgs\n- liaised with BanklessDAO and DeWork to implement the co-marketing initiatives for Infinite Hackathons\n- created a profile allowing Infinite to use Devpost for Genesis Bogota\n- got DXD token on Bubblemaps and coordinated co-marketing\n- attended a couple of meetings of the newly formed Carrot product UX/UI squad and joined discussions\n- saved 33k COW /peanuts in usd/ from being incorrectly allocated to farmers due to a discrepancy in the UI.

Since then I participated in dxGov team. Initially I started supporting dxvote while we started building guilds (DAVI project now). Like these past months, last period dxGov team was focused on DAVI development, working on some smart contract tasks and improving processes such as releases, workflows with the qa team and roadmap visibility. Personally, I think that we are maturing as a team and we are reaching a stable and constant rhythm of work that also allows us to project a little better. Full review of last period can be founds [here](https://daotalk.org/t/milton-contributor-proposal-25-07-2022-18-09-2022/4428/2)\n\nFor this period the scope of my work will be very similar to what I have been doing. The focus is on DAVI in pursuit of moving towards gov 2.0\n\n**Goals:**  \n- Continue to work on DAVI development according to the [dxGov roadmap](https://davi.canny.io/). I assume that now that we will be doing more regular deployments and the app is being tested by more users, there will be several bugs/feedback to cover.\n- Continue testing the dapp, finding and creating new issues to add to our backlog.\n- Work on dxdao governance smart contracts v2 if help is needed (either writing or reviewing code). We did a small part of it during the last period with daostack contracts but still a lot of work to be done with the VotingMachine and other contracts.\n- Help the QA team move forward with integration testing and continue the discussion on how we can work better together. I know that the dynamics of a project in the process of being built and having deadlines means that sometimes quality and testing are put aside a bit, but I think that we must make greater efforts as a team to restore the balance and focus much more on having an integration test suite that serves our interests and those of the qa team to build something solid.\n\n**Responsibilities:**  \n- Collaborate with dxGov squad by delivering quality code.\n- Spend a good amount of time doing code reviews for Davi, dxvote, and dxdao-contracts.\n- Being an active member of the squad, participating in meetings/discussions, being available to my teammates in any circumstance they need me.\n- I will participate in the hackathon as a mentor and will be available for the organization in everything that is necessary.\n \n\n**Timeframe:**  \n2 months. From Sept 19, 2022, to Nov 11, 2022.\n\n**Compensation:**  \nExperience Level: Level 4\n\n**Time commitment:** Full-time ( 40hs/week )\n\n**Payment:**  \nI will claim 90% of the total because I took some days off after the retreat\n\n$10800 DAI  \n$7200 DXD vested for 3 years with a 1 year cliff starting 19/09/2022.  \n6566 REP (0.3%) based on the latest REP supply on mainnet at the moment of submitting onchain proposal  (2,188,873 REP)\n\n**Work Experience:**  \n[Daotalk - Worker proposal [25/07/2022 - 18/09/2022]](https://daotalk.org/t/milton-contributor-proposal-25-07-2022-18-09-2022/4428)   \n[Daotalk - Worker proposal [30/05/2022 - 24/07/2022]](https://daotalk.org/t/milton-contributor-proposal-30-05-2022-24-07-2022/4263)  \n[Daotalk - Worker proposal [04/04/2022 - 29/05/2022]](https://daotalk.org/t/milton-contributor-proposal-04-04-2022-29-05-2022/4116)   \n[Daotalk - Worker proposal [07/02/2022 - 03/04/2022]](https://daotalk.org/t/milton-contributor-proposal-07-02-2022-03-04-2022/4003)   \n[Daotalk - Worker proposal [13/12/2021 - 06/02/2022]](https://daotalk.org/t/milton-contributor-proposal-13-12-2021-06-02-2022-trial-period/3793)    \n[Daotalk - Worker proposal [29/11/2021 - 10/12/2021]](https://daotalk.org/t/milton-contributor-proposal-29-11-2021-10-12-2021-trial-period/3686)   \n[Dxvote contributions](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3AMiltonTulli)  \n[DAVI contributions](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3AMiltonTulli)  \n[Dxdao-contracts contributions](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3AMiltonTulli)  \n\n----------\n\n**Period reflections:**  \nInfinite hackaton, Devcon and Dxdao retreat happened in the middle of this period. Naturally, many important things happened for me during this period that has broadened my vision in relation to the ethereum ecosystem, our mission in dxdao, and what I would like my role to be in all of it.\n\n**Davi** work was good. I was focused ( as is usual in last periods ) extending the actions builder functionalities and fixing some bugs in general. Code reviews where ok too but I can always improve on the time I spend on it. I think DAVI release process was a big win and I am very happy that we have now beta versions live. I think that there are some parts of our code that have grown a lot to cover new functionality and maybe we could think in the future to get more precision in what we are going to build to make better decisions about how to do it. I consider that having the roadmap is a big step towards it, and we must continue the efforts. In my opinion, Dxgov is a team that moves very fast, very focused on delivering code, and I have the feeling that it is very important to reinforce instances of joint reflection to solve big problems, instead of giant finished contributions from one person. After the retreat, I was able to perceive, like everyone else (I think), the urgency with which dxdao needs gov2.0, so that from now on all our energies are directed better than ever towards that goal.\n\n**Infinite Hackathon **was great. We did a POC of onchain and offchain multivote for [DAVI](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/398) called [Akira](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFOd0YPPeE/dn-XjNB80_ipGdVuMF_1mw/view) using [dxdao-contracts](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/222), something I had in mind inspired by Augusto. It was very good to meet @borisblock and work together with him and @dinocres , who also did an excellent job. We were able to show DAVI to Boris more in depth and get great ideas and designs from him. I would like to continue working on this in the next period since is something that can add a lot of value.\n\nI enjoyed a lot my first **devcon**.I learned a lot about ethereum, I met people from very different projects, I was able to share with some people what we are doing in dxdao, learn about governance and about the challenges that other daos are having. On a technical level, it was good to keep an eye on the latest news, projects, libraries, protocols, etc: I have a long list of thins to investigate. It was very stimulating to see how many people are working for a more decentralized world.\n\nIn terms of the dao I think the retreat was very positive. I think it was important to meet everyone (almost) and to know what they do for the dao, what their responsibilities and challenges are. I liked the activity that Lateral team proposed. I think there was a lack of clarity about dxdao’s mission among contributors, and this activity tried to achieve unity in the criteria that I think is now much clearer. I was sad to see that not all those present contributed to the activities, but the entire retreat took place with great respect and we enjoyed the time together. Being that it was the only time we were all together, I think it would have been important to have more time with the dxgov team to do some kind of evaluation and review planning for the future.\n\nDuring this period also worked fixing the issues reported by Team Omega after audit of the Gov 1.5 smart contracts. I worked mainly on controller refactor and test coverage and it was good to to better understand how it works and how contracts (controller, avatar, schemes) interact with each other.\n\n**Pull requests during this period:  **  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/327](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/327)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/351](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/351)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/354](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/354)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/358](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/358)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/381](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/381)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/385](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/385)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/396](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/396)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/415](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/415)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/348](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/348)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/325](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/325)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/234](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/234)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/253](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/253)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/255](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/255)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/257](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/257)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/263](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/263)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/268](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/268)  ","title":"7.

We did a lot of work planning this and I am really pleased with the discussions we had as a team and the end result. We have a clear file structure, well abstracted code, unit test and even storybook.\nOnboarding - During the last period, DXgov onboarded another developer, Dino. He has super smoothly onboarded and already is adding great value to the team. Although admittedly I cannot take all the credit for this one.\nDocumenting - Documentation of everything DXgov is doing I feel has been far better, the notion is now back in a state I am happy with and fewer conversations and decisions are being made in keybase chats.\nProject-DAVI - Splitting up our applications into DAVI and DXvote-legacy I believe will help a lot with people’s understanding and eventual branding of DAVI into a real product. Despite being something we should maybe have done from the start I am happy we made the decision.\nPartnerships - I have been in talks with a couple of teams both about technology we can utilise in DAVI for the social layer as well as potential users of the governance we are building, both of which will be important for DXgov.\nDid ok:\n\nPlanning - I think overall I have been putting more time into planning DXgov and steering it in the right direction but there is still so much I feel I could do here. The Q2 report is likely the most obvious example of this and something I want to do more of to improve transparency and accountability.\nQA - We began onboarding QA into DXgov only recently but I still think I should be spending some more time here.\nCould have done better:\n\nTime management - I had this issue previously a few months ago where I felt like I was being very reactive to issues as they occurred and not making much headroom with other tasks. I managed to get better at this for a while but feel more and more like I am slipping back into working like this. Selecting a single task to work on and getting back into note-taking I think should help concentrate my mind and prevent me from context switching around a million issues.\n\nBEGIN KEYBASE SALTPACK SIGNED MESSAGE. kXR7VktZdyH7rvq v5weRa0zkLTK50O n6efJRAsAf1W1Na LbaPFnWlIPPTjIS 2VR42d9ihAv7wMZ h95pERrrJzrrz96 J32bPuQ6ynB2wTd 16LWHjBp0RJkPSJ XkQpPSjxtfCldkY QPfr0u0Y0MLAyyo GNcSGuLnhgN85zi hXpDjMME3gkcgsg BphHNBfOmgW6H6h NiEeezKygqvYO60 fKXTcBtoaTDFHJ5 uUIhxgg8JQYy7rM 2SE0mZYZ0ZnGs46 5lV8w3B0aO.

Tested for release of [v1.3](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-info/pull/13) and [v1.4](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-info/pull/24) \nCreated a few feature requests related to include [farming page](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-info/pull/22) on DxStats, Violet has worked on this and this needs to be finalised and released.\n\n\n#### Backlog refinement and fixing the Github / Zenhub issue workflow.\nSetup [Zenhub for Swapr](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/swapr-611e5f16daa13f001932934e/board?repos=209400598), it still needs enhancement and a good way to see the roadmap and what we are working on. \nWe started having 2 standups a week within Swapr that has increased the coordination and brought faster feedback time from my perspective. Daniel from SpaceInch has been great help in coordinating all of the Bridge related work, while I did my best to get him help in clarifications where needed.\n\n#### Launching Swapr and DxDao base on Arbitrum.\nWe had a few hiccups during the initial launch, but I was involved testing the SWPR Wallet Scheme and different types of proposals in Arbitrum. I would have loved to spend more time getting involved with gov_dev, but had time constraints and a lot of knowledge constraints as to how governance is done technically. \n\n#### Additional stuff apart from whats in the proposal\n- Setting up Armada FM with Chris Powers. Need to followup on when this podcast will be going Live.\n- Part of coordinating farming campaigns in Arbitrum along with Keenan, Powers, Nathan and a lot of others.\n- While Zett owns the Swapr product, I am doing my best to help manage his vision by being a project coordinator for Swapr. This is something that I will do in the future as well to relieve Zett from day to day activities and get him time to think and design more strategically.\n- Setting up of [gitbook](https://swapr.gitbook.io/swapr/) for Swapr (in progress) and looking for contributions towards finishing this up. Kindly reach out to me if you want to brainstorm and structure this. Once this is setup, we will move this to dxdocs.\n- Working on SWPR staking and governance (along with Zett and Federico) and would reflect this in the Nov-Dec proposal.\n\nFor payment, I would like to request the following:\nAugust - 3500 USDC + 1372 REP + 4.78 DXD vested\nSeptember - 7000 USDC + 2767 REP + 9.56 DXD\nOctober - 7000 USDC + 2787 REP + 9.56 DXD\n\nI was also nominated for a shipping bonus of USD 1000 that was passed part of this onchain proposal [here](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xeb8b5bce32abf6fbf9efb03352be243a94b193a950a5cf5d8af64c57efa6ce2d)\n\nIn total, 18500 in USDC + 23,9 DXD vested + 6926 REP\n\n**Reflections and Improvements:**\n\nReflections:\nThis is my first proposal where I became a full time contributor for DxDao and I hope I lived upto what I proposed. Some things that I hoped to have accomplished was \n- Get features shipped more often and try to get a proper cadence in Swapr releases.\n- Be available more in Discord. \n- Get Swapr backlog and workflows better, to make sure the team is aware what is expected atleast 3 to 4 weeks before.\n- hopefully recruit more and recruit better.\n\n\nSome areas that we could improve:\n- We seem to be involved in a lot of parallel tasks, but it drags a bit to get them to completion. \n- Resource availability: Feels like I am drowned to figure out who is available at what day / time and find it hard to get to a routine. I end up going around in circles chatting away on multiple chats, and end up having a feeling that I have done very little. Hopefully, I will be able to find a rhythm towards it. *Miss the standups from web2 world here.*\n- Contributor onboarding: we need to find ways to onboard more quality devs, \"buddy\" them?? if they are coming from a web2 world or not used to RCF. We need to push a bit on the revised contributor UX model as well as they might help us be competitive towards other products. We are short atleast by about 15 to 20 contributors across the DAO in design, dev, marketing, support.\n- Marketing: We need to do atleast 5X more marketing, getting involved with community, how we measure organic growth, what initiatives we take. This directly affects all our products' growth, reachouts, branding et al. \n- The 1 hour everyday calls: Would love if we can think and brainstorm a bit about how to make this better structured and communicated. Perhaps, a TLDR version of what happened that week in the calls would be a great way to engage and interact with the community.\n\n**Shoutouts**:\nFederico, Zett, Nathan and Keenan - Just because of how awesome they are.","title":"Venky - Aug / Sep / Oct 2021","hash":"Qmf12Hnmj4gsmqy8UvsWcbJ4MoRpaw16Ut9XJGRYMUgm1g"},"0xd6a4e540fb5781d79a733d366588588567d7f29800a7d3558761a457eebfcc30":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

It also goes into deeper detail surrounding the protection of rights and decentralization of wallet infrastructure. \n\nBut wait, what’s going on? Why is this initiative necessary? Read on for some context:\n\n>There is a lot going on in the Web3 space today regarding censorship. [Since the U.S. Treasury Sanctioned Tornado Cash](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916) and the arrest of [Tornado Developer Pertsev](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/24/alleged-tornado-developer-pertsev-must-stay-in-jail-dutch-judge-rules/), discussion on the [subject of censorship](https://twitter.com/hoprnet/status/1561367522678640640?s=20&t=eArJ8-ShRvxLzJ6DPrN80w) and decentralization has been rampant and visible all over the web, especially with [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) fast approaching. Some are even saying that “Ethereum is under attack and it's not clear if it will survive.”\n\n>Regardless, organizations all over the globe are discussing the subject and while some are quietly protesting, other [more prominent players are taking a stronger stance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/24/crypto-sanctions-tether/). No matter what the intensity of your stance is right now, it is clear that everyone in the Web3 space needs to make their voice heard, however quiet it might be.\n\nFollowing the discussion leading up to the DXdao [“Code is Speech”](https://twitter.com/DXdao_/status/1558119876174102530?s=20&t=JgMEQnwCuafbcgU0iW3Cjg) tweet, we felt it only fitting to coordinate on a community level and prepare a signal proposal to indicate our alignment and commitment to true Web3 decentralization and privacy.\n\nWe invite the DXdao community to participate in this pledge at an individual level (there are rumors of an airdrop associated if that's what's needed to kick your voice into gear). More importantly, following any discussion in this forum thread, a signal proposal recapping the above will be submitted to DXdao’s Gnosis Chain base that would indicate DXdao taking this pledge. The values represented in the pledge are very aligned with DXdao; we should do our part as an organization to signal support for initiatives that support our vision.\n\nYou can find a [link to the pledge here](https://tally.cash/web3pledge/).\n\nThanks!","title":"Should DXdao support the \"Tally Ho Community Pledge\" [Signal Proposal]","hash":"QmThp67oWQHcKmX5xvxoGh8iEqKXYwo2axX4b698kD3FEj"},"0xd891621300fb5cd46a7962787f4d2fa85998bfb5524aae4b1784a620c562fdae":{"description":"This proposal suggests the following changes to the current compensation guidelines:\n\n- New [payment structure]([here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmfF6Jp6KJCCZXz6At6n5tFt2zxkzPSTo68KQU31tFL7th) ) featuring eight levels\n- Shift to 3 year vesting schedule for DXD alongside paying DXD at market rate\n- Introduction of bi-annual bonuses funding allocation\n\nIf this proposal passes, we will be transitioning away from the current payment structure. The new proposed payment structure can be found [here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmfF6Jp6KJCCZXz6At6n5tFt2zxkzPSTo68KQU31tFL7th). \n\nTo further clarify and explain the proposed level guide and compensation we have prepared a Q&A to answer any pertinent questions. \n\n**What does this look like burn rate wise?**\n\nThe projections below are calculated based on current contributors and estimates about their future levels.\n\nMonthly USD burn rate: **$169,000**\n\nMonthly DXD burn rate: **$148,500**\n\nTotal monthly burn rate: **$317,500**\n\nYearly USD burn rate: **$2,028,000**\n\nMonthly DXD burn rate: **$1,782,000**\n\nTotal yearly burn rate: **$3,810,000**\n\nAt a price of $743.03/DXD:\n\nTotal DXD locked in vesting yearly: **2398.29**\n\n% of circulating supply: **5.65%**\n\n% released in year one: **0%**\n\n% released in year two: **3.77%**\n\n% released in year three: **1.88%**\n\n**How will the market rate for DXD be determined?**\n\nThe market price of DXD will be determined by taking the average DXD price over the last 1 month in US dollars calculated on Swapr. In addition, we would also add a floor price for DXD vesting, which is enacted if DXD were to ever trade below the value again at the ATH price in 2020 of $523.  This is also the amount used as ATH price since the end of 2020.\n\n**How will new levels be determined for current contributors?**\n\nOnce passed through governance, contributors should closely assess the language presented in the new compensation structure and have a discussion with their squad lead or other relevant contributors to their vertical. Contributors should make an educated decision surrounding their level based on the updated level descriptions and any feedback received. If a contributor doesn’t feel a level completely describes them, they should start at a lower level. Although there is no direct conversion, generally speaking contributors are likely to fall within the following levels:\n\n**Current Level\nNew Level to consider**\n\nLevel 1----    Level 1 - 3\n\nLevel 2----    Level 2 - 4\n\nLevel 3----    Level 3 - 5\n\nLevel 4----    Level 5 - 7\n\nLevel 5----    Level 6 - 8\n\n**When will the new compensation structure go into effect?**\n\nIf this proposal passes on mainnet and xDai, the structure will go into effect on January 1, 2022.\n\n**What if I have an active worker proposal with the old compensation when this goes into effect? Will it be retroactive?**\n\nIf it passes, this proposal will go into effect on January 1, 2022. Compensation earned after this date is eligible to use the new guidelines as a reference point for compensation calculated.\n\n**How do “Promotions” work with the new level system?**\n\nLike all worker engagements, promotions are led by the individual contributor, who can apply in a new worker proposal to be at a higher level. The community will provide feedback on the worker scope in the forum and squad leads are encouraged to vocalize when a contributor in their squad has misrepresented their level, be it to the low or high end. REP holders will use various signals from the community and collective to determine whether or not to approve the “promotion” to a higher level.\n\n**What is the goal of shifting to a 3-year vesting schedule for DXD ?**\n\nMoving to a 3 year vesting schedule helps align long-term incentives among contributors and DXdao. DXD will be locked with 1/3 vesting after 1 year of the contributor contract start date, and the remaining 2/3 vested through a linear schedule after the 1-year cliff, fully vested at 3 years. Specific details of parameters around DXD vesting will be addressed in a separate proposal. \n\n\n**How much funding are we looking to allocate towards bonuses?**\n\nWe suggest allocating $100k every 6 months towards bonuses for DXdao contributors in a mix of USD and DXD compensation. This amount is 5% of the overall compensation budget ($1.9m).\n","title":"DXdao Pay Structure Update - December 2021 ","hash":"QmPwJkeiY1r5yWhtYHkQA6tUbiZzr336RenWbz2JkUEBGc"},"0xd8a5a36e7e358e15fe6d62fb337427ec4c28302571a67956b4079fd8b1305f9c":{"description":"**Timeframe**\n\nNovember 29th 2021 to January 21st 2022, 2 months\n\n**Background and Responsibilities**\n\nI will continue filling my position as a part time contributor within the Contributor UX Squad, as an assistant to Melanie.

At the hackathon @JohnKelleher gave an excellent presentation and I was able to successfully recruit one of the newest members of Aqua, @ross\n    * With the help of all contributors at DXdao, our first DXEvent happened earlier in July at ETHCC & Paris Blockchain week and I would say it was a success! Details around this event can be found here.\n       \n* What I did okay\n*  Last period, I thought the Contributor UX was beginning to have a grasp around how to improve the inefficiencies in the contributor proposal process. Most contributor proposals were submitted on time, and we saw a decrease in outstanding contributor proposals. Unfortunately, we are still experiencing the submission of late proposals and how they affect the community, as evident here. This period we will continue to work on improving this ever evolving and challenging contributor proposal process.\n\n    \nWhat I need to improve on\n        \n\n * I think I did okay at collaborating with @chrispowers and @keenanluke on the implementation of our compensation overhaul. As apparent here 1, our proposal did not pass in the community, and there is still some work to do in order to gain consensus on a new compensation structure.\n* An ongoing initiative of mine is around incentive programs for DXdao contributors and community members. I would have liked to have implemented a referral system, but did not have the opportunity to. This worker proposal I will be making the referral system a top priority.\n    \n\nCompensation:\n\n   * Experience Level 4\n* Time commitment- 100%\n* Contributing to DXdao since 3/22/2021.\n* Full-time for total of 40 hours per week, for two months (8/2/21- 10/1/21). 50% to be paid once the proposal gets approved and 50% on or after 10/1/2021 when the work agreement finishes\n    * Month 1:\n            $7,000 (xDai)\n            $5,000 (DXD).

We already have accommodation secured for the 2 weeks, and are finalising on some activities as well as sponsorship opportunities. For any help or questions anyone may have make sure to DM either myself or Melanie.\n\nThe Q3 report is also coming up - most notably with a new L2 we're present on (albeit, not sure if we'll have funds in it by end of the quarter). Q3 will also start tracking all assets DXdao holds i.e. ENS Domains for now. \n\nTDP V3 also passed on mainnet - which will be executed over the coming weeks. See: https://daotalk.org/t/treasury-diversification-proposal-v3/3263\n\nWe're also close to buying back a further $1M in DXD - which will likely be followed by a further proposal to potentially expand the buyback further.

I plan on using a laptop more often just to get more used to it - and when I have to travel just plan to do work I'm more comfortable with on a laptop.\n\nI've also started playing around more with web3py - firstly to do the gas governance refunds - and am now looking into tracking our own products that way i.e. tracking SWAPR LPing / fees easier by logging events directly from the smart contracts. \n\n\n**Compensation:**  \n- Experience Level: 5  \n- Time commitment: FT\n\n**USDC** 16000 for 2 months, 1/2 to be sent on the first payment proposal and 1/2 on the second payment proposal  \n**DXD** $12000 based on the all-time high of DXD of $691.14 i.e. 17.36DXD using 18th September 2021 as starting period for the vesting.  \n**REP** 0.3334% for 2 months, 1/2 (2778) to be sent on the first payment proposal and 1/2 (2777) on the second payment proposal\n\n**Note:** This proposal also claims the 1k retroactive bonus passed on-chain here: https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xeb8b5bce32abf6fbf9efb03352be243a94b193a950a5cf5d8af64c57efa6ce2d\n\n**Work Experience:**  \n\n[Worker Proposal 18th March - 18th May](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x39adce2e254d06a55ff8fa18701be30dbdeadf6f47c88017f4daf66bc77d06d4)  \n[Worker Proposal 18th May - 18th July](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x4d0342054907e5d280df392963fbb6abb83b366a8563ce6e64d13a74f8e8d82b)  \n[Worker Proposal 18th July - 18th September](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x81ddeb16fb7650468ec81808f29cab998a358fe606a67e3bcd10f7dc8da20e23)\n\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis proposal falls under the current Contributor Guidelines, enacted on February 17, 2021.

Call leads should indicate which parties are expected to attend each call. \n\n- *EG: Devs only on the developer calls.*\n\n4). **DXdao will *temporarily *require all new contributors to pass a proposal on-chain to start their engagement.**\n\n- This would be imposed until the passage of Phase 3, unless otherwise mentioned in an upcoming signal proposal.\n\n- This restriction would not disallow new contributors outright, but instead require an on-chain vote BEFORE approving a trial period or other engagement.\n\n5). **DXdao will launch the DXD guild with 4% REP and commit to further governance discussions to scale this REP percentage higher following deployment**.\n\n- Action 1). Launch the guild and grant it 4% REP.\n\n- Action 2). Commit to further discussions surrounding increasing this REP allocation before Governance 2.0 implementation.\n\n6). **DXdao will immediately disengage from contractors**.\n\n- This would presently encompass [Space Inch, a group of blockchain devs](https://daotalk.org/t/space-inchs-contribution/4568) operating for DXdao since July of 2021.\n\n- This action does NOT involve severing connections with any entity.

The upcoming Lisbon Blockchain week appears to be a great opportunity to hold such a retreat. Not only is Lisbon an up and coming tech-hub, but its geographical positioning is also convenient for the majority of DXdao contributors - being easy to reach for both European based contributors as well as those in the Americas.\n\nLisbon Blockchain week runs from the 18th to the 24th of October, with the following events already scheduled (and more to be announced):\n\n[LisCon](https://liscon.org/) 20-21 October\n\n[ETHLisbon 2](https://www.ethlisbon.org/) 22-24 October\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThis proposal suggests a DXRetreat to take place the week before the Lisbon Blockchain week. Namely, from the 10th of October until the 17th.\n\nThis proposal aims to cover all accommodation costs from the 10th to the 25th of October. As well as a budget for team building and workshops during the DXRetreat.\n\nAn informal poll showed interest from ~17ish people to attend. After receiving some initial quotes for accommodation, €15k seems a reasonable amount to plan with. This comes out to roughly €60 per person per night. Moreover, a budget of €5k seems to be reasonable to cover activities / workshops during the DXRetreat week.\n\nThe accommodation prices above are estimates, as it ultimately depends on the number of people attending. However, we need to reserve those places as soon as possible, as there already is a very limited selection of places available in Lisbon to accommodate such a large group. The idea behind using the MS, is that MS signers can verify bills and only disperse exact amounts.\n\nThe further €5k is for workshops and team building activities during the DXRetreat (10th to 15th). Which, with an attendance of 17 people comes down to ~€50 per day per person. Nothing has been booked yet, but when we do want to book something, we’ll have to move quickly with the payment and passing an 8 day on-chain proposal everytime we want to book something seems highly inefficient. For this, this proposal authorizes €5k to be sent to the MS. \n\n**Funds**\n\nThis proposal sends a total of €20k ($25k USD) to the DXdao MS wallet - from which funds can be drawn gradually to cover costs. Retaining the funds in the MS adds a layer of security. Any eventual remaining funds at the end, will be returned to the DXdao treasury.\n\n**Notes**\n\nFurther proposals will likely be created to cover costs for Lisbon Blockchain week - such as funds for sponsorship, covering transport for contributors as well as daily allowances. This proposal is submitted first, due to the urgency of booking accommodations in time.\n\nThis proposal is submitted on Mainnet as a signal and funding proposal and also submitted on xDai as solely a signal proposal.\n","title":"[Signal Proposal] DXRetreat 2021 - Lisbon","hash":"Qmcfez1yqPLVsiPXBYhxZXQ79tVRzu3z68xDAB2i9rF5yA"},"0xdaf023cc457f48230ac5f464bf4bea2260df52ce6e37268612d13ba660e207a6":{"description":"Proposal below would approve the 1H 2023 DXgov Guild Budget.

It will document their visions, objectives, and responsibilities, contributor roles and compensation, as well as other pertinent expenses to be reviewed and approved by the DAO as a whole.\n\n## Guild Structure\n\nNetworks: Ethereum, Gnosis Chain\n\nPlatform: DAVI Soulbound\n\nGuild governance members:\n\n|Entity|Soulbound %|Address|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Ross|20%|rossdev.eth|\n|Augusto|20%|augustol.eth|\n|Madusha|20%|madusha.eth|\n|Milton|17%|miltor.eth|\n|Kenny|13%|vangrim.eth|\n|Dino|9%|dinocres.eth|\n|Tomas|3%|pulen.eth|\n\nGovernance Rules:\n\n* Cannot earn additional governance power past 30%\n* One month of full-time contributions to Operations guild earns 1% of soulbound governance power in the Operations Guild (rounded down value of what 1 month represents in the initial distribution)\n* Need 2% to submit a proposal\n* Initial distribution based on time in DXgov which was founded in Sep/21\n* Monthly rep distribution will be done in one proposal to eliminate gaming the system by delaying rep mints\n\n## Vision and Mission\n\nDXgov is responsible for the development and maintenance of DXdao’s governance platforms and products. Originally this only meant building and improving DXdao’s own governance, however it has since evolved into a product for others after receiving feedback and demand for our take on governance.\n\nThe current contracts; guilds and gov 1.5 (the forked governance architecture from daostack) make up the majority of the smart contract work.\n\nWe are building Project DAVI as an interface and product that supports both of the systems mentioned above in a flexible front end aimed at improving the UX of autonomous on-chain DAOs like ourselves.\n\nDXdao’s restructuring and discussions at the 2022 retreat set out a new vision for DXdao: “Enable community freedom” this has also impacted DAVI’s place in DXdao and scope of work. We had already been exploring more advanced features beyond simple governance such as integrating a social layer tightly coupled to governance decisions and discussion. However, this vision and direction also identified DAVI as a more core interface to bring communities more power and access to our ecosystem.\n\nThe priority for this period remains on core DXdao governance work but will also begin further exploring how DAVI fits into what DXdao is building and how we can enable community freedom.\n\n## Overall Guild Milestones and goals\n\n* Governance 1.5 supported by DAVI (DXdao able to begin the transition to new contracts)\n* Rich contracts 2.0 - New UX for proposal decoding and encoding\n* Social MVP complete\n\n* Governance 2.0 Voting machine complete and off to audit\n* DAVI ready to support the upgrade from 1.5→2.0\n* Social v1 complete\n\n### Longer term goals\n\nThe idea identified in phase 2 of restructuring with DAVI being the central interface to the DXdao ecosystem. This would require UX improvements that give DAVI DAOs features not found in any other DAO interface (DAO-DAO voting, social integration, non-technical governance, accessible autonomy, etc). However, the ecosystem aspect would require a lot more features to be developed with far more integrations between squads. And since this UX would be core to the DXdao ecosystem and other products would be dependent on DAVI onboarding DAOs (users) and giving those DAOs good support, more resources would be required. The scope of the application would increase as DAVI would become not just the main way DAOs operate but the main way to use DXdao’s products.\n\nThe ecosystem approach has been identified as the direction of DXdao in the phase 2 proposal but details are yet to be decided. To build DAVI into what it will be beyond just DXdao close collaboration between all squads will be essential. The first steps will be to scope out features, and integrations, build a wireframe of DAVI in this role and analyse the feasibility of this product direction.\n\n## Budget Summary\n\nThis proposal approves the following future expenses as summarized below and further detailed in the accompanying spreadsheet\n\n![Screenshot 2022-12-13 at 14.07.23|617x500](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/daostack/original/2X/6/6afeba0fbdb9574ca4aa14231b629e14f69d0c06.jpeg)\n\nEdit1: Added ethernal development tool for $20 /month\n\nEdit2: Added designer after discussing with Voice squad (Boris - 50%) and deciding the DXgov budget is the correct place for the cost. Also updated accuracy of stipend calculations and added gas costs as a contingency for deployments.\n\n\nSome notes: \n- \"Development contractors\" under \"other costs\" is a budget specifically for features which are more efficiently implemented by outside resources, an example would be parallax developing our orbis social integration. It is also the intent of DXgov to have standing bounties for specific standalone features which would benefit DXgov and DAVI greatly but are not currently prioritised for contributor resources. \n- For the budgets generally, QA has been planned as a separate resource and so was included under \"other costs\" \n- Level increases were included under \"other costs\" as contingencies which would be posted publically in the DXdao general forum for comment and approval\n\nAnd a comparison to a year ago for these same squads:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-11-30 at 19.12.26|690x150](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/daostack/original/2X/6/629d5b1c8e3012ce81fa40038af0db39a96fc6f6.jpeg)\n\n## Squad Metrics\n\n### Objective: Improve DXdao’s governance system\n\n**KR1:** Governance 2.0 contracts should be implemented with full tests\n\n**KR2:** Governance 2.0 contracts should be sent away for audit\n\n### Objective: Support multiple governance systems in DAVI\n\n**KR1**: Have a Gov >1.5 (forked daostack architecture) DAO working in DAVI production\n\n(The distinction of 1.5 and 2.0 is small in terms of the UI and will depend on the operational speed of supporting 2.0)\n\n**KR2:** Explore, publish research and if decided important begin support for more governance systems in DAVI\n\n### Objective: Bring external communities into DAVI\n\n**KR1:** Onboard at least 1 external communities onto DAVI\n\n**KR2:** Write and maintain non-technical documentation\n\n**KR3:** Release a DAO launcher UI in DAVI\n\n### Objective: Provide the best DAO UX in the space\n\n**KR1:** Implement v2 of rich contract data (a key UX system in DAVI)\n\n**KR2:** Integrate the social aspect of governance (currently a forum) inside DAVI\n\n**KR3:** Conduct user surveys that aim to answer whether non-technical users can utilise autonomy in DAVI DAOs\n\n### Objective: Support DXdao ecosystem\n\n**KR1:** Identify, communicate and work with other development guilds on potential integrations with DAVI\n\n**KR2:** Support at least one integration to another DXdao product (action in DAVI proposal builder)\n\n**KR3:** DAVI should be used by DXdao contributors almost daily as their main governance interface\n\n(partially dependent on operational speed of moving main DXdao DAO to new contracts)\n\n### Responsibilities\n\n* Supporting DAVI\n* Maintaining operatable DXvote until it is no longer in use\n* Educating about DAVI and governance systems\n* Facilitating discussions on DAVI integrations\n* Deploying new guilds and DAO contracts\n* Regularly releasing new stable versions of DAVI\n* Alongside other squads, help plan what DAVI will look like inside the DXdao ecosystem as a key interface\n\n## Guild Personnel\n\nIndividual contributor lists, contributor level information per[ approved guidelines](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xaa3c6d9953d5510a0f014f946e94f03f07a4e5259718e86f07d41d255917e410), and time commitment as a percentage of full time.\n\n|Contributor|Level|Time Commitment|Description of Role|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Ross|Level 6|40 hrs/week|Lead, DAVI architecture and occasional dev|\n|Augusto|Level 8|10 hrs/week for first 3 months|Smart contract lead|\n|Madusha|Level 5|40 hrs/week|DAVI architecture and dev|\n|Milton|Level 5|40 hrs/week|DAVI and smart contract developer|\n|Kenny|Level 4|32-40 hrs/week|DAVI dev and leads retro sessions|\n|Dino|Level 3|40 hrs/week|DAVI dev|\n|Tomas|Level 2|30 hrs/week|DAVI dev|\n|Boris|Level 4|20 hrs/week|DAVI designer|\n|Totals||252 hrs/week||\n","title":"Approve DXgov Guild H1 2023 Budget Proposal","hash":"QmfMgMvktaNA4CqcbzRCxJLKz3cMMjLRPZJ4RqchFmmTVA"},"0xdb3eb3a026586cddb60e39a48f1ffa6a9007d1b5b3d0be8c0afc9ad2fe263059":{"description":"Test spending DAI","title":"Test spend DAI","hash":"QmQQAs5xZSp2e58W3UFziFQDDmMiNtBEHHyi4dfq5Hovq1"},"0xdb42e8960f8523311c5860ed3b081d4d027662986c54547cb218d9f5ffdc48c7":{"description":"I 0xSpicySoup#5803  am requesting\nREP in relation to my DXdao Discord participation level.

Hence, there would be three daily stipends paid out, amounting to a total of 3*$250 = $750. The daily stipend is intended to cover accommodation, F&B and daily transportation.\n\nIn other words, keeping EthCC as an example, DXdao would provide contributors attending the event a total stipend of $500 + 3*$250 = $1250 (~€1000).\n\nMoreover, this proposal also signals an intention to hold a yearly DXRetreat - likely held around events which a large number of contributors already attend.

So far they have been going well with a few kinks and learning experiences, but overall positive. The added structure keeps the team more focused and aligned with our goals while providing more room for feedback and retrospectives on how things are going.\nSprints · GitHub\nDiscussions · DXgovernance/dxvote · GitHub\n\n**EthLisbon&Lessons from Lisbon** - The retreat, conferences and conversations I had in Portugal were some of the most important parts of my worker period. I think I represented DXdao far better than I did in Paris. All of this helped me form a more clear vision of where DXgov is going in the future and what we can build. This was summarised in a presentation and later written up in a forum post Lessons from Lisbon re: DXgov\n\n**State of DXgov** - I wrote up the current state of governance in support of the Augur partnership for a high level introduction to what we are doing. It was received well (400 reads on the forum) thanks to the support of DXvoice and I’m looking forward to writing more articles in this style - The State of DXgov\n\n**Augur partnership** - Although not something I was super involved with I was happy to be part of the conversation with Augur where we informed them of our governance and what we could build for them now and in the future. Both @JohnKelleher and @AugustoL took the main lead on this I still feel I was able to provide value and will do more in future.\n\n**Onboarding** - The past 2 months has seen the onboarding process of three new devs into DXgov. Although one didn’t work out I think @luchux and @Milton have both been doing fantastically. Despite the very obvious need of better documentation for all parts of DXgov I got good feedback from both and they very quickly adapted and learnt about the project. (documentation is WIP)\n\n**General understanding** - I’ve focused a lot on gaining a deeper understanding of our governance architecture. Focusing mainly on the new DXvote architecture, new wallet schemes and guilds. This is something I am most proud of in the past 2 months as I finally feel confident in many aspects of the architecture and am able to suggest solutions properly utilizing the existing architecture well.\n\n**Guilds** - Long put off in favour of improving DXvote, we have finally begun proper work on guilds. Spurred on by the Augur partnership we have begun focusing on the guilds implementation. Although just beginning I believe the plan of implementing guilds from the ground up with a squad focused on maintainable code and good design and then taking this over to DXvote afterwards will work out well. There has been a lot of learning here also as I haven’t worked with a dedicated designer on a dev team before and although it changed processes a little @corkus has been doing great work.\n\n**DXgov twitter** - The idea of this twitter account was born from talking to people about governance in Lisbon. Having a squad specific twitter account focused more on documenting the challenges of governance and how we are taking a different approach to most as opposed to promoting a product is an important part of what we are doing with governance. It’s still in its early days and despite going relatively well I think there is still more we could do with this. (finding the right conversation threads was more difficult than expected)\n\n**Could have done better:**\n\n**Bugs** - As anyone following DXvote you’ll know we have had many issues over the past couple of months regarding bugs. This is almost naturally a bi-product of scaling a team and evolving a production application in the ways that we are. Regardless a lot can and has been learned here and I’ll be trying to avoid it in future. All the issues have been resolved as quickly as we possibly could and additional processes have been added throughout our product development lifecycle to reduce the risk of these. There is still a lot that can be done in this regard however.\n\n**Relayer** - I mentioned in my previous proposal that this would be something I aim to push along however I had no time for it. As the responsibilities and goals of DXgov increased this fell to the wayside, which although it cant really be helped its still something I could have communicated better that I didnt have time for it.\n\n**Payment**\n\n**$8300\n**\n\n**7.36 DXD** vested for 2 years and 1 year cliff @ $679.63/DXD - Calculated from previous proposal\n\n\nPrevious two proposals were created automatically but used xdai REP total and so were off as we use mainnet for REP calculations\n\nPrevious minting for oct-dec start proposal = 2068\nActual rep due, calculated from mainnet rep at 18/10/21 = 2788\n\nPrevious minting for aug-oct start proposal = 1640\nActual rep due, calculated from mainnet rep at 18/10/21 = 2215\n\nThis proposal + remainder of oct-dec start + remainder of aug-oct end\n\n2788+720+575 = **4083 REP**","title":"Ross Neilson Worker Proposal 18/10/2021-18/12/2021 - END","hash":"QmeyqGdQKRbcSez13nimeg4oePSsiPnZD4YYePHXytZb9k"},"0xe03d013efeca08f6d0949861290bb2e8332d5dfe35f9516674ef5c208d84a91c":{"description":"**Self Reflection on previous worker proposal:**\n\n**Did well:\n**\n- Swapr new Swapbox implementation.\n- Always available to help when I could.\n\n**Did ok:\n**\n- Attention to product quality when developing.\n\n**Must improve:\n**\n- Take time to review more PRs and with a more detailed review.\n- Participate in DXdao dev calls.\n- Participate in DXdao governance and community.","title":"Leonardo Berteotti Contributor Proposal [21/02/2022 - 15/04/2022] [END]","hash":"QmcC3Ne5xZh3r2CbZz1SrCaA847MorxL1hbGvepWTi6t5s"},"0xe09044e9c9b31546a3eb783f07f50ca59b0a871275834a4890e489e13f691f2b":{"description":"This proposal is requesting 3.4553 DXD for a member balancer.

[See Post](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-to-retain-outside-counsel-for-dxdao-legal-questions/2844)\n\n**Summary**\n\nRequest funds to (1) retain outside legal counsel for advice on DXdao’s legal structure and compliance questions, and (2) schedule meetings with tax specialists to answer questions on how to track crypto earnings for DXdao contributors.\n\n**Background**\n\nI’ve been a community member and contributor for the past 6 months, and have recently transitioned into a general counsel role with DXdao. In this new role, I’ve met with contributors and spoken at meetings about the need for DXdao to retain outside counsel.\n\n**Polsinelli, PC**\n\nTo my knowledge, DXdao is one of the only DAOs that exists solely on the Ethereum blockchain. I love this about us: we’re an innovative DeFi community that operates in a truly decentralized manner. However, with our innovative structure comes lots of interesting and (sometimes) complex questions on how to conduct business. These questions will continue to arise as DXdao changes and expands its product portfolio. In order to serve the interests of the DXdao community, it would be helpful to have a law firm with expertise in fintech on retainer and available to remediate any future compliance issues.\n\nTo help DXdao with this need, I’ve received a quote for a retainer from Polsinelli, PC, which is a full-service national law firm based in the United States. The firm has strong fintech, securities, corporate, and venture capital practices. Here are the lawyers that will be on retainer:\n\nStephen Rutenberg: Stephen A. Rutenberg | Professionals | Polsinelli\nDan McAvoy: Daniel L. McAvoy | Professionals | Polsinelli\nFiammetta Piazza: Fiammetta S. Piazza | Professionals | Polsinelli\n\nThe initial retainer is $5,000 to be billed at an hourly rate. I plan to use the law firm sparingly, and will come back to the community at any point if a new round of funding for the retainer is needed.\n\n**Tax-Specific Questions**\n\nI’ve also had meetings with DXdao contributors on taxation questions regarding invoicing payments from a DAO. Because our contributors live all over, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to these questions. In order to clarify best practices, I’d like to take 2-4 meetings with tax specialists in various jurisdictions. In order to fund this, I am requesting $500. I’ll hold these funds in an attorney trust account and bill any payments against the $500 and return any leftover funds.\n\nIn gathering this information, I’ll share anything useful with the DXdao community on how to deal with crypto earnings from a DAO based on residence.","title":"Proposal to Retain Outside Counsel for DXdao","hash":"QmZWMSNdMqbrbwzMFFiPTe6DZv2JtomSXSn4uZbPpqJhtr"},"0xe1f20a1a49a873e53b03605e664a32863e78f1bdcc9de447a1d22f4012b5895a":{"description":"# June and July payment proposal\n\n### June-July reflections\n\n**Swapr:**\nMost of the time was spent around testing the Swapr Beta.\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/275\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/278\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/281\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/288\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/289\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/290\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/291\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/292\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/293\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/301\n\nApart from the PRs, I was also working on the SWPR token's initial analysis of liquidity mining and the distribution of SWPR during the liquidity mining campaigns. \n\n**Carrot:**\nWorked along with Federico and John on testing the functions and making sure that the reward tokens are distributed based on the KPI conditions are met or not. This was not a huge activity in June, but took a few hours a day for a week.\n\n**Omen:**\nPerformed testing on Omen's release and suggested improvements on My Markets. https://github.com/protofire/omen-exchange/issues/2007\n\nAlso, came up with a few ideas on running the Euro markets along with other members of the guild and I guess it was a wee bit successful in terms of how the markets were created and executed. \n\n#### Reflections:\n\nHighlights: I think I was able to contribute across multiple products to the best of my time available.\n\nThings that I could have done better:\nDefinitely I could have foreseen my lack of availability in July. Feel a bit gutted that I couldnt contribute efficiently. It kinda slowed down the release cadence as timely feedback was not able to be provided.\n\nThings to improve:\nBetter testing and documentation around Swapr.\nGet a bit of efficiency in processes and releases into Swapr.\n\n#### Compensation:\nAs per the worker proposal for the month of June, I am asking for the below compensation.\n\nStable coin compensation - 4375 xDai\nREP award - 1629\nDXD vested - 5.98\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1b7h16H.png)\n\nFor July, the time I spent was very sporadic and was very inconsistent. I still managed to work on finalising Beta 2 release, test the following PRs that will go out soon as part of Beta 3 or after.\n\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/294\nhttps://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/pull/276\n\nSo, I will not ask for any stable coin or DXD compensation, instead I would ask if I can get REP for the 5 days I worked.\n\nREP award - 0.04% - 105 REP","title":"Venky - payment proposal - June and July","hash":"QmZzvQnL17p6drQPShCCoxABkMrHvS97QBdeECphcGNLKX"},"0xe1f93f69569ef7630c17c3ee8080c844ca4768907383ac29e0c01889fd7c4a36":{"description":"## Period review\n\n**The good:**\n\nI kept the productivity at the level regardless of the fact that we had a period at DEVCON as well as the Infinity hackathon, and also handled well the fact that we were left without one member of the QA team who contributed significantly to the whole process.\n\nI also notice that there are fewer and fewer bugs on Swapr thanks to constant manual testing and automation tests.\n\nCommunication with the team is still excellent both in private chats and on public channels where I monitor what is happening and prioritize testing in relation to the releases that are happening and the importance of the scope of PR.\n\n**DEVCON BOGOTA**\n\nFirst, I would like to thank the community that made it possible for me to attend that event.\n\nAttending the event meant a lot to me because I exchanged a lot of experiences with other DAOs and projects and their QA members or teams. So I was able to research new tools and frameworks that we could implement and that would mean to our projects.\n\n**Could be better:**\n\nI could better predict the changes that came by switching from Rinkeby to the Goerli test network and in that way prepare everything earlier for the transition from one to another network, but considering all the other events, I managed to not be noticed that some automation tests were skipped as I manually tested.\nThis will be resolved in the coming period.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\n- Experience Level: Level 4\n- Time commitment-100%\n- Contributing to DXdao since 1/3/2022\n\n**Time commitment:**\nFull-time 40 hours per week, for two months (14/9/2022-14/11/2022)\n\n\n**Previous work:**\n\n- https://daotalk.org/t/milan-v-contributor-proposal-1-3-2022-14-3-2022/3995\n- Milan V Contributor Proposal [14/3/2022 - 14/5/2022] - #4 by Milanv95\n- Milan V Contributor Proposal [14/5/2022 - 14/7/2022]\n- Milan V Contributor Proposal [14/7/2022 - 14/9/2022] + Paris stipend","title":" Milan V Contributor Proposal [14/9/2022 - 14/11/2022] Second half","hash":"QmS6Dp7Yajd5h2e3k6qtKHqEWD6vjw9NpEBtKQubacjqV9"},"0xe21254eb74584c8a59c3eb34ba35fc0037e9b5041f3475384722cf03f95ccd88":{"description":"The past proposal https://dxvote.eth.link/#/xdai/proposal/0xbd62b6722c7a7ac41365b00eb1b5399aceb5aa4c446c033a503f2bc1eea4f3ee had a wrong valu being set, I used 259200**0** instead of 259200, the right amount of seconds in three days is 259200\n\nThe current parameters of the Quick Wallet Scheme are:\n\n- Queued Vote Required Percentage: 50%\n- Queued Proposal Period: 7 days (604800 seconds)\n- Boosted Proposal Period: 2 days (172800 seconds)\n- PreBoosted Proposal Period: 1 day (86400 seconds)\n- Boost Threshold Constant: 1.2\n- Quiet Ending Period: 1 day (86400 seconds)\n- Rep Proposing Reward: 0.00 REP\n- Reputation Loss Ratio: 2 %\n- Minimum Dao Boost: 0.05 DXD (50000000000000000 in wei)\n- Proposal Boost Bounty Const: 100\n- Activation timestamp: 1633938351\n\nThe voting parameters were set in this tx: https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/tx/0x6a5a7713dc04574c9a7112b9e3e787dfbe4ed8112da6856762b05145a0ed7319\n\nRaw parameters:\\[50,604800,172800,86400,1200,86400,0,2,50000000000000000,100,1633938351\\]\n\nAnd have the following voting parameters hash is: 0x3e232a4742c68a919452659487920dfef1ac475e70097d34a182a1ee8890e21b\n\nYou can use the DXDVotingMachine in rinkeby (same code as xdai) to get the parameters hash in https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xBa51391385A6bD5ECA0217d7e843B29227E72508#readContract using the getParameterHash function, using address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 as voteOnBehalf\n\nThe proposed new parameters are:\n\n- Queued Vote Required Percentage: 50%\n- Queued Proposal Period: 7 days (604800 seconds)\n- Boosted Proposal Period: **3 days** (259200 seconds)\n- PreBoosted Proposal Period: 1 day (86400 seconds)\n- Boost Threshold Constant: 1.2\n- Quiet Ending Period: 1 day (86400 seconds)\n- Rep Proposing Reward: 0.00 REP\n- Reputation Loss Ratio: 2 %\n- Minimum Dao Boost: 0.05 DXD (50000000000000000 in wei)\n- Proposal Boost Bounty Const: 100\n- Activation timestamp: 1633938351\n\nRaw parameters: \\[50,604800,**259200**,86400,1200,86400,0,2,50000000000000000,100,1633938351\\]\n\nVoting parameters set in this tx: https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/tx/0xaeac74df9eb4de7186e1a6461f86ad50df1e30d12a816a5bfce83aaa7c86aa72\n\nAnd have the following voting parameters hash is: 0x56052f01e2469d1c171a8b3243a0e8fb23c934620e6387b6d699ce9bb590b6a3\n\nYou can use the DXDVotingMachine in rinkeby (same code as xdai) to get the parameters hash in https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xBa51391385A6bD5ECA0217d7e843B29227E72508#readContract using the getParameterHash function, using address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 as voteOnBehalf\n\nIf you call parameters with the new proposed voting parameters hash `0x56052f01e2469d1c171a8b3243a0e8fb23c934620e6387b6d699ce9bb590b6a3` in https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x053f406aD40c9Eb8eB43aFf28DA0D0EC17dF8e44/read-contract you will get the new proposed voting machine proposed valued.","title":"Set Quick Wallet Scheme Boosted Proposal Period to 3 days [Good One]","hash":"QmPSkSrD5YkB4x5UixpiNrjfgPf6ndaNLyUZ7AqH16NrAF"},"0xe2412388f4fbf33a12e437b0bc912e8cf6f9d6a141840ce4122d0644cbb03b2e":{"description":"**Overview **\n\nThis is a proposal for the initial Epoch of Coordinape for DXdao’s End of Year AppreciationDAO rewards funding.\n\nAs outlined in this proposal here the ContributorX squad is requesting an allocation of 25,000 WXDAI from xDXdao to the DXdao Dev Multichain MS on Gnosis Chain to fund the pot for distributions.\n\n** Epoch Details:**\n\n1.

I’ve been following DXdao for some time, and I have a lot of ideas for how I can contribute to the Marketing efforts here, specifically to Omen. I was formally introduced to the community by @JohnKelleher and have talked with @KeenanL about projects to work on during my trial period. I also discussed my contribution plan with the Marketing and Communications team as a whole on the most recent call.\n\nI’ve been a user of various online prediction markets, and I understand the pain points the online prediction markets community struggles with. Omen provides excellent relief from the problems associated with the most popular online prediction market, Predictlt. Omen has significantly lower fees, no betting limits, and is decentralized. But despite Omen’s numerous benefits, the platform suffers from few users and low liquidity. My primary focus will be on closing this communication gap and allowing Omen to realize the full potential of its underlying technology! In the next 2.5 months my goals are to start and execute on the following initiatives:\n\nAcquire users for Omen\nIncrease awareness of Omen within the online betting community\nProvide marketing and writing support for a variety of projects\nTime-frame:\n\nTrial Period: 17th May 2021 - 27th May 2021\n\n27th May 2021 - 31st July 2021 (contingent on the trial period)\n\nResponsibilities\n\nConduct marketing and build awareness for Omen across a variety of channels including online prediction markets-related Telegram chats, Discord servers, and the comments section on PredictIt\nWrite Tweets for DXdao and Omen\nAssist with a variety of projects where I can apply my marketing and writing expertise such as the DXdao rebranding, updating the copy on the DXdao landing page, and any other projects that may arise\nDeliverables\n\nMarketing page comparing the differences between PredictIt and Omen (this is a very favorable comparison for Omen)\nGuide to Omen for users who’ve bet on PredictIt or another online prediction market before, but are new to Omen\nGuide to Omen for users who are completely new to betting on prediction markets\nThe marketing page and guides I create will be essential for Omen to acquire additional users and realize the full potential of the platform. I will also use the comments section of PredictIt to inform PredictIt users about the low-fee alternative of Omen. This has been a highly successful strategy for Omen’s leading competitor Polymarket, it’s how I found out about Polymarket , and Omen would be wise to learn from this success. I’ll also conduct guerrilla marketing and awareness building across a variety of other channels including prediction-markets related Telegram chats, Discord servers, and more.\n\nCompensation\n\nLevel 3, Full Time\n\nTrial period (50%):\n\nBase Salary: $1500 DXD: $1000 REP: 0.0417%\n\nContingent on successful trial period, following two months (80%):\n\nBase Salary: $9600 (80% x $6000/month x 2 months), 50% to be paid at the beginning of the work period and 50% to be paid at the conclusion of the work period DXD: $6400 (80% x $4000/month x 2 months) REP: 0.2666%\n\nWorker Experience\n\nMy professional experience is in marketing and writing, and I have a Bachelors in Business Administration from Northeastern University.

I guess, this is it now, below./\nSummary of and reflection on my work to help you evaluate my contribution and arrive at a decision. /I will not rush to submit this to Alchemy until a few days later, giving you time to comment if you feel the need for it./:\n\nAs a business developer, I primarily care about raising public awareness of our products, growing our satisfied user base and stakeholders’ value, through work on both B2B & D2C relations. Although, personally, my alignment with the DAO is first and foremost ideological, and far less financial, I do wish to be an active member of the organization and be able to participate in decision making, so the time has come to revisit my worker proposal and hopefully earn my first reputation. I may forget to mention something, but here it is:\n\nInitially, I needed to get a feel of the status quo, so I conducted a survey as an attempt to gain a better understanding of our strengths and weaknesses as an organisation. The results showed me the conviction shared by the team, which was only dampened by the unanimous acknowledgement of the lack of time and human resource as our primary hurdle in acting on our ambition. I found this information of great benefit.\n\nThat led me to dedicating time trying to attract skilled contributors to our organization. I am glad my search brought good results.\nI can call Melanie a friend, as she has been very helpful to me, and also it really warms my heart when she reaches out to me, whenever I can be of assistance.\n\nI use the time-zone difference to help keep an eye on our social media channels /Discord, Telegram/ at odd hours and chime in whenever community members need help. I try to be active and promote our services organically without overdoing it, not to achieve the opposite effect and turn someone away.\n\nI also began creating memes, which in my opinion are valuable brand assets /a picture is worth a thousand words/. Interestingly enough, it is helping me with stress as well. I will also start sharing those on my Twitter feed.\n\nI have been attending the daily calls of the Mesa team. I tried to attract a very skilled developer to come on board and fill the gap in our dev team. At one point it was almost a sure thing, but in the end it didn’t work out. I am also trying to find a studio to outsource the front end work. There is one which might work out soon, but it’s not a done deal yet. I am also happy helping Martin and Nico with the documentation. In general, I definitely see my presence in the squad as a positive, supporting the team and sharing opinion when I am able to. In a recent chat with Keenan and Zett we discussed how important it is for a team to be able to keep up the pace in the absence of the lead. I can attest that when Martin took a few days off for a holiday, Adam, Hamza, Nico and I kept working and communicating without disruption.\n\nIt is somewhat a similar experience with the marketing and communications squad. I have been happily attending meetings whenever possible and I do believe that my input brings value in reaching consensus and the overall decision making process. I hope that I’ve made it clear that I am always sharing my honest opinion and speaking my mind without reservation, yet luckily, my character isn’t such that I’d expect things to go my way /there is no ‘mI way’, only the WEi/. Given the limited resources, I believe the squad is doing great. Thanks to Keenan and John, tere are amazing people joining us lately and I’m very optimistic and excited for what’s to come.\n\nFor fear of jinxing it, I try to avoid mentioning something before I have good reasons to believe it may happen. There are businesses I have had or I am still having conversations with. There are also others that I haven’t even successfully gotten throught to yet /not for the lack of trying/. One hardly ever knows with certainty when an initiative will fall through or one will manage to pull it through within a desired timeframe. It takes both patience and perseverance, one just has to constantly keep being creative and move forward. It can mess up sleep and one can’t tell a week day from the weekend, but when you love what you do, it doesn’t take too big of a toll. Sometimes a breakthrough can be achieved in just an hour, somethimes it takes months. Also, at times one comes up with ideas that don’t meet wide approval, but for me it is just a part of the process of thinking outside the box.\n\nIt took a while, but we finally managed to get Swapr on CoingGecko.\nWith Sky’s support and building on his prior relationship with 1inch, we are officially in the queue to list Swapr.\nFollowing up on John’s idea and with Keenan and Federico’s help we got Swapr on DeFi Llama.\nIn the near future we’ll consider DeFi Pulse.\nTogether with Keenan we’re working on getting DXdao, Swapr and Omen on DeBank. We might need everyone’s support to upvote a proposal soon, but first Keenan will pull some strings.\nWe’ve got a promise to get Swapr on LiquidityFolio.\nWe’ve got contacts at ETH Global, and we’ll revisit the connection with a solid plan moving forward once we have a fully-formed marketing and communictions squad.\nThere is interest to explore a partnership with the team at GitCoin, involving Omen, Mesa and Swapr. To be revisited in July as per their request.\nWe have initiated contact with organizations that can bring DXventures in on investment opportunities, in our pursuit of supporting teams tackling pain points in DeFi, in order to help grow the ecosystem. This will also be benefitial to our product suite, especially Mesa and Swapr.\nWith the support from John, Geronimo, Sky and Chris, we took productive steps to improve our relationship with the team at xDai, resulting in really exciting developments.\nSelf-Relfection:\nI acknowledge that I personally could have definitely done a better job. There’s this saying I like a lot: “Don’t move the way fear makes you move. Move the way love makes you move.” Hardly anyone does this in their worker proposals, buy I wish to convey to you what I expect from you. I’ve mentioned in previous posts that data is the new gold, and that communication is the key to successful teams. We’re doing great, but starting with myself, let’s all please, move even more out of love, and less out of fear. Please forgive me if I’ve done something out of fear, it’s not who I am nor I want to be. Whatever I do comes from my heart.\n\nGoals:\nI was recently reminded by the contributor experience squad that this proposal is a bit overdue and that within the next two weeks I’ll have to follow up with a proposal for the next period. When I first submitted my proposal I couldn’t have included any of the above, because honestly I had no clue what would happen. I only knew that I wanted to give it my best. I hope the results are not disappointing. There is a lot to follow up on, and a lot more to achieve. I’m sure many new opportunities will spring up, but I’ll struggle a little trying to be precize in what to expect to be delivered in the next period, apart from assuring you that I’m commiting to the cause again at 100%.\n\nThe more you help me, the more I can help, and I believe we’ve all done great.

This is their 12th proposal. The proposal below is a payout for November 2022 totaling $8,704. Below is a recap of the contributions along with links to a Master Service Agreement and Scope of Work that govern the relationship going forward. These are written as contractual agreements between DXdao and Space Inch. Passage of this proposal is a “signature” from DXdao to those agreements.\n\nTimeframe\n\nNovember 1 - 30, 2022\n\nResponsibilities\n\nOskar (karczuRf):\nOskar in November has been focusing mainly on two big features: upgrade wallet library and LP-Zapping.\n\nThe first one was about integrating the newest version of web3-react library to fix plenty of bugs and improve user experience while using Swapr. The task is completed, so the code was reviewd and checked with approvals. Currently is ready to be merged. The PR can be found on Swapr-dapp github repo: feature/upgrade-wallet-library by karczuRF · Pull Request #1330 · levelkdev/swapr-dapp · GitHub.\n\nThe second task LP-Zapping is brand new feature in Swapr. It allows to swap any token for 2 different tokens and add liquidity to the pool with just 1-click. It works also in another direction, so allows to remove liquidity from the pool and swap pool’s tokens to any different token, obviously also with 1-click. It is worth mentioning that zap feature is innovative as allows to use any DEX supported by Swapr, so with EcoRouter zapping is cost optimized and flexible. It is also prepared to use it with new DEXs if needed. To achieve it Oskar by himself has written brand new Zap smart contract (with test) and deployed it on Goerli testnet and Gnosis network. Also he fully adjusted Swapr frontend to use Zap contract, so dedicated designs and user-flow components were added. Currently Zap feature is waiting to be tested by QA and reviewed. The PR can be found on Swapr-dapp github repo: Feat/lp zapping by karczuRF · Pull Request #1596 · levelkdev/swapr-dapp · GitHub.\n\nIn the meanwhile Oskar was doing daily routines, like reviewing the code or discussing project development.\n\nMarek Kowalski:\nMarek handles code reviews, project oversight and architectural proposals.\n\nJosh Segall:\nJosh provides general oversight and strategic advice about roadmaps, product, and process.\n\nCompensation\n\nWork Completed from November 1 - 30, 2022\n\nTotal Price = $8,704\n\nLink to Master Services Agreement and Scope of Work 2\n\nLink to SOW for Project #2 Development Work Proposal for Space Inch - Project #2\n\nExperience\n\nSpace Inch started in 2010 by making mobile games and produced 90 million installs of original and published games. Now Space Inch primarily works as an outsource technology partner and consultant to various clients. Space Inch has offices in Nashville, Spain, Poland and Croatia. Space Inch’s services include strategic consulting, UI/UX design, discovery/scoping, architectural planning, engineering, and quality assurance. https://spaceinch.com/ 1","title":"Space Inch Development Work November 2022","hash":"QmdamVRFVdM1HdBw3xYWYEMN966MhVKietwVu14gRQt1K7"},"0xe797bc68050bc3f315cf857ee14077285115cfd44c9635756dc13146c966f7b8":{"description":"\n    \nThis proposal places a 7 WETH order on CowSwap for DXD.

I aim to expand the experimentation and initiatives that DXvoice is pursuing with new ideas like InitiativeDAO.\n\n**Governance:** Leading by example, I will continue to be a highly active governance participant in DXdao, including on-chain actions (review, staking, voting) and the processes and discussions that allow DXdao to remain secure and effective, proper treasury management, open discussions, and standing up for core values. I aim to bring extra initiative to the governance processes. I also aim to push forward the future of DXdao governance by liaising with the DXgov Squad.\n\n**Other/ContributorX/Product/Testing/Strategy:** I include this category to account for all other value I plan to contribute to DXdao as a core contributor.

It wasn’t supported because we had prior plans in the works. I still think this professional could help DXdao largely.\n- Created a Contributor-Sourcing DXbiz Collaboration initiative as an exercise to expand the opportunity field within DXdao.\n- Introduced a proposal to implement rotation program on the main DXdao multisigs\n- Increased attention and time towards helping with Infinite Genesis - initiating the Infinite Squad, organizing, gathering potential participant feedback, coordination, recruiting and more\n- Originating the idea of making DXdao a stronger force attached to Infinite Hackathon for awareness purposes. At first the DXdao brand was hidden from most of Infinite.\n- Presented on “[DAOs & Unconquerable Product Ownership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEV7ocjuQpw)” in the headline time spot at The DAOist Bogota to a packed audience, again highlighting Swapr as a great example.\n- Secured the opportunity for Ross to present on “[Accessible Autonomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWamW8Ug_nE)” at The DAOist Bogota\n- Meat of October was focused on in person representation of DXdao at events in Colombia including Devcon and numerous other events.

Others are now implementing.\n- Troubleshooting and improvement finding\n\n**DXgov:**\n- Providing detailed major feedback for the initial release of DAVI\n- Continued attention to DAVI\n- Working with Ross on strategic opportunities for DAVI\n\n**DXD Token Working group:**\n- Participating and bringing ideas to the DXD Token Working group discussions\n\n**Self Evaluation:** The following is a self-evaluation on what I’ve done well, okay, and not well.\n\n* **Did Well:** Thinking about the future paths of DXdao, what the core structural issues are and what needs to be done to position DXdao to succeed. Increasing exposure for DXdao, Swapr and Infinite.\n* **Did OK:** Communications channels with squads are now more open and honest than previously. Understanding why they were closed and addressing these issues further will continue to improve things.\n* **Needs Improvement:** Transferring knowledge to those who are asking for it.

Design related tasks were communicated well through detailed descriptions from members of DXdao, as a result of this I was able to focus a lot of my time on design curation and less time in meetings, which was a definite plus. Overall, I really liked the process and can’t wait to crack on more tasks. Also, big thanks to @Melanie for curating my DXdao journey.\n\nOver the past two months I was working on the following:\n\n- DXdao governance 2 year anniversary POAP\n- Several Swapr banners for social media\n- DXdao social media banners, such as EthCC, TheDaiost and EthLisbon\n- Logo design for DXvoice\n- DXdao announcement banners: Q2 treasury update and DXdocs announcement\n- Multiple logo designs for the Aqua MVP\n- SWPR launch and airdrop related banner designs\n- Images for SWPR token Medium article\n\nMy timezone made it a bit tricky to schedule calls, despite this we managed to have very productive calls with the aqua team. Also, it was not the best factor for certain tasks that needed to be completed fast, however, I did my best to finish them in time.\n\nLooking forward, I think I can improve on my initiativity, communication and work more closely with DXvoice.","title":"Borisblock — Contributor Proposal [05/07/21 - 05/09/21] (Part2)","hash":"QmeQPf7LzULpb7oKxPc6NPVPENGCr8BwbaUx2iBvodmD5X"},"0xec9f0b6961fff3c12f7fa80745997311de28135cbb3a2e3c0798eb9c82fffc64":{"description":"I,Tom-FR, am requesting REP in relation to my DXdao Discord participation level.

DxDao Hackathon and Retreat 2](https://daotalk.org/t/draft-proposal-dxdao-hackathon-and-retreat/4130)) to explore the possibility of hosting a retreat in Colombia after Devcon VI in Bogotá 1.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThis draft proposal suggests a DXRetreat to take place the week after Bogotas Devcon VI, between the 17th of October and the 22nd, near the city of Cartagena.\n\nThe DXRetreat will be a four day event, with spaces for connection, co-creation, distribution of knowledge, personal/mutual learning and also recreation, in a context of connection with nature away from the city (for more information on the location, contact @Melanie).\n\n## Budget\n\nThe cost for the hotel for 5 nights will be a total of 68,216,000 COP, which translates to 15,802 USD at today’s exchange rate. This is to be paid in two installments: one as soon as possible for the reservation purposes and the second 10 days before the event.\n\nThis cost includes accommodation and breakfast for 22 contributors and 3 facilitators from Lateral for 5 nights, transportation to and from the location from Cartagena and exclusive use of the accommodations.

This was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-aug-sept-2021-draft/3167).\n\nBelow is a reflection on my work during the proposal period\n\n\nBelow is a recap and review of Caney Work’s August and September scope of work. See this post for [Caney Fork’s Oct/Nov proposal draft](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-oct-nov-2021/3418).\n\nWhat I did well:\n\n* Had a baby! Well, my partner did. This has been a whirlwind and an absolute thrill. I took 2.5 weeks off over this work period.\n* Buyback - we easily reached the $1m purchase goal by 9/30 and the buyback was then extended again. And while there are many things to improve (speed, new methods, etc), facilitating the buyback is a core function of my role.\n* Helped onboard Nissa and facilitated engagement with Position Co along with Melanie and Contributro UX squad. This was an interesting experiment over the last few months of finding specific talent for DXdao.\n* Helped facilitate relationship with SpaceInch. The development team seems to be happy with their work and I think it can be a model for how DXdao engages with contractors in the future.\n\nWhat I did okay on:\n\n* SWPR launch on Arbitrum - Swapr squad, DXvoice and others did a fantastic job of conducting and communicating launch and addressing the few snafus that arose. This is a big accomplishment for DXdao and “did okay” for me bc I played a small part.\n* DXvoice and content creation - happy contributor to DXvoice and can now do the MIR with Keenan in my sleep. I felt my output during this proposal was below previous months.\n* Gov_dev & Gov 2.0 development - I’m very happy with the emergence of the gov_dev team and cannot take credit for anything there but Dave and I are forming a great working relationship with Augusto/Ross and gov_dev team, building for our own governance needs.\n\nWhat I did not do okay on\n\n* Time management - with the baby, I need to get into a new rhythm in my work week. It was challenging to switch from working whenever to having huge chunks of a day (or the weekend) where I’m disconnected. I was late with some things, this worker proposal and recap and the Buyback extension proposal could have passed 5-6 days before when the ceiling was reached. I need to work on planning out my weeks, and I also need to narrow the scope of things I engage with.\n* A resolution to DXD vesting. This is a major “to-do” that I have not been able to complete. We discussed it in the community and reached soft consensus but I haven’t put it all together for something we can move forward on.\n* I feel that we need more of a structure for getting larger governance proposals through (DXventures, Treasury, others). Perhaps we need a more formal ‘signalling’ process to help things get along, but I feel there is a governance process void that I should be filling.\n* Compensation change - the proposed plan did not pass and there should have been a better governance process for coming to that decision.\n* We need to get better at incorporating DXD holders into formal governance. It’s hard to run dual-tracks (especially with 3 bases) but we should figure out ways to engage before Gov 2.0\n\nCompensation:\n\n* $7200 as Level 5 Worker \n* $5400 DXD, priced at Coingecko ATH on Sep 1 ($567) or 9.52 DXD a month vested for 2 years with a one year cliff, to be issued once a payroll system is in place\n* 2490 Mainnet REP","title":"Caney Fork Payout September 2021 ","hash":"QmQXHvGFBvbJts15xPSdummU5Cz7jdDYXFtAgQf6StR5ds"},"0xefdb670d40e9a6972f0d5921e49057608e120edcff8048f4b4c19a01c456c7df":{"description":"This proposal launches a WETH / WBTC farming campaign that starts Thu Nov 11th 2021 at 15:00 and ends Thu Nov 25th 2021 at 15:00; distributing 23,100 SWPR tokens over that time period.\n\nREP holders approved the SWPR token and farming campaigns through a[ signal proposal that passed in August](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x2d00135332c28271ba27c6f02f9aa79a480b4d7c58df37fb30e6a55353470910).

This last period was full of surprises, stress and most importantly - accomplishment. Much of our work in the previous months has culminated in the SWPR token and farming launch on Arbitrum - to what can only be described as a resounding success thus far. I am incredibly proud of the Swapr squad and everyone involved in the launch process, and am excited to continue to move Swapr forward together.\n\nThis proposal also marks an important milestone in my DXdao journey. Within my first non-trial period proposal I had indicated a “long term career goal of attaining experience level 5 within 2 years.”. Since that proposal I have transitioned from a support to a lead, made DXdao and its products my primary focus, and coordinated many initiatives including the operation of the newly established DXvoice squad. I have received incredible support from other DXdao contributors regarding a level increase from 4 to 5, representing me reaching my personal goals far before I had anticipated. My journey has been incredibly fulfilling and exciting thus far. Regardless of whether this level change passes at this time - there is nowhere I would rather be than here.\n\nRest of DAOtalk thread can be found here: https://daotalk.org/t/keenan-luke-contributor-proposal-for-09-2021-to-11-2021/3343\n\n**Experience Level: 5**\n\n**Full-time.**\n\n### Month one.\n\n$8,000 (xDai) + $81 (xDai).\n\n$6,000 (DXD).

DXdao will implement a six-month squad-based budgetary cycle and shift contributor proposals to their respective squads. **\n\n- An exact solution and specifications will be explored in Phase 3; this action ascertains DXdao’s shift to a squad-based budgetary cycle.\n\n**2). DXdao will commit to the exploration of “accountability councils” within Phase 3, ultimately aiming to implement an intermediary step between execution and governance if feasible. **\n\n- DXdao recognizes that a step between execution and governance would integrate a significant degree of accountability. This action ensures that DXdao will commit to further exploration of “accountability councils” or other initiatives that could effectively fall within this step during the third Phase of its restructuring.\n\n**3). DXdao will implement a “priorities board” and a democratic process of determining said priorities.**\n\n- The “priorities board” will guide the execution of overarching goals at DXdao. This action ascertains that DXdao will implement the required processes when it makes the most sense.\n\n**4). DXdao will formally establish its overarching vision as “Enable Community Freedom.”**\n\n- This operates as a vision statement; the specifics of the mission statement and further actions will be determined within Phase 3. If these statements change dramatically during exploration, they will be reflected in the final signal proposal – this action ascertains a direction.\n\n**5). DXdao will formally establish its direction as a “Decentralized Pipeline for Communities” and look to prioritize a “flagship” product that interconnects current and future product initiatives.**\n\n- Similarly to the above, if during exploration an alternative emerges, it will be reflected in the final signal proposal. This action ascertains a direction for DXdao to take its product focus when digging into Phase 3.\n\n\n","title":"Restructuring and Refocus | Phase 2: Accountability, Access, Anatomy (Structure) [Signal Proposal]","hash":"QmVhRBqZYq1MSDtWUGCvf8Sw3BdFP3asPZ6EDejjiZjngT"},"0xf1a0826d6988b24084ba6e65331d55eb8d033dafaba6c87e1747a2868c31380f":{"description":"This proposal is requesting a payout for the work done from 15/05/2021 - 15/07/2021 with a duration of 2 months.

Therefore, this phase should be utilized to take immediate action on subjects unlikely to require significant discussion, greatly benefiting from a quick governance process.\n\n  \n\nThe governance process, including discussion and building off of the initial draft laid out in the \"[Restructuring and Refocus – An Alternative Proposal](https://daotalk.org/t/restructuring-and-refocus-an-alternative-proposal/4522)\" thread, should take place immediately after the passage of the \"Alternative Restructuring and Refocus Process\" Signal Proposal. The goal should be to agree and execute Phase 1 as soon as feasibly possible, with a proposed deadline for *passage* by September 30th, 2022. However, DXdao should aim to pass phase 1 before this date.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n### ## Phase 2: Accountability, Access, Anatomy (Structure).\n\n  \n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wNm19bvv9ZLdJbi1-LeAqUIG5lcVqdKJVJkYq9O_GTxB_4SKyUMrlV_OsmSdppTP8SNcKWLt-iNUu_tCtESMsf4Nt7dNa_OivSVwv6Lf5YNRh1owSMMlMWqacu1zDIVZOgAllIp2VlHXlLykGXOTD6sYKiNn9uXT820R3mu94moxFpld7YSxql3Pog)\n\n  \n\nPhase 2 represents the meat of solving our core issues. How do we prevent \"no because the solution is not perfect\" and other cultural problems? How do we incentivize budding talent and new ideas to flourish? How do we keep leaders accountable for the deliverables of their squads? Finally, how do we make DXdao profitable?\n\n  \n\nThe governance process, including discussions in the forum and in-person in Bogota, should take place immediately after the passage of Phase 1. DXdao community members participating in the events in Columbia, and the contributor retreat, should strategically utilize the time to find solutions to these complex topics. DXdao should reach a consensus shortly after the events in Bogota, aiming to *pass* a proposal for **Phase 2 by October 31st, 2022**.\n\n### ## Phase 3: Stepping back while pushing forward\n\n  \n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/X9R93wFO226cvrtFnbZXHtvN4d3U0JkbSOIWoYP8IXuxQUFke5juhyyaYaOuzf7vYgc8YPSGfx4BGEqWE3NfM1vYFC1S35qq674gxQ_ya7SHq9cpJoanLJE1ONjzQ9tUd9d1poCWCrLy8uZx4I0_1Xa_XlnZXBlaGqHHk9HpeuBoxeCTFt4RPbPWeA)\n\n  \n\nPhase 3 represents difficult discussions surrounding the newly introduced priority justification and its implications on the budget. By focusing on financial viability and accommodating our overall budget, we can trim away fat where needed while still focusing on capitalization of essential opportunities and crafting a unique suite of products.\n\n  \n\nActions of Phase 3 will largely depend on the discoveries and outcomes from Phase 2 and could have a variety of implications. For example, perhaps budget reductions if we cannot identify areas to capitalize on or instead increases in areas deemed positive returns or value adds.\n\n  \n\nRegarding timelining, Phase 2 will need time to be discussed and propagated throughout the community. It is a large basket of structural changes and is likely to require some additional problem-solving time. Once DXdao agrees on the solutions, it should pivot to these significant changes, whether stepping back, pushing forward, or both, in immediate succession. DXdao should aim to reach a consensus and capitalize on structural changes, if and where necessary, by **December 16th, 2022**.","title":"Alternative Restructuring and Refocus Process [Signal Proposal]","hash":"Qmastxr26Yo7K6VASeK4qSQcEcUdxKvYtdR2yLJFvhVXYe"},"0xf471a6907934ba65576c1914c35c8027171d6faf0796da544a04185cabecb438":{"description":"Background & Retrospective:\n\nThis will be my last worker’s proposal so I’ll use a slightly different format. I have been working in Swapr adding functionalities and additional chains.\nWhen I started working at DXdao, although I had development experience, I had no web development experience. This impacts my ability to fully contribute to the level the DAO deems necessary. I made a huge effort to learn and have been doing so from the start. I believe my performance has been improving but understandably it is not yet at a desired level. I believe that it was possible, with time, to get it to level or even find a niche where I could contribute more but at this point it is not possible.\nI believe this happened in part due to a different expectations, specifically stated above, between the DAO and myself. Open and honest communication is extremely important and I always strived to keep that as one of the virtues people saw in me while working. I believe this is one of my highlights during my tenure here, which I find unfortunate it is ending.

Potentially not happen until Q2 2022.\n\n#### Done well\n\n- Buyback program: running the GPv1 solvers is completely on autopilot. I do not do much about it, except for cleaning old logs periodically and checking health status.\n- Onboarding and helping Milan to start helping with The Graph.\n- Helped with the Single-Sided Staking campaign subgraph.\n\n#### Could have done better\n\n- I could not do many code reviews because of the time constraints on my own tasks\n- I failed on the Accountability document.

This should allow the platform to own their own liquidity, fundamental to the correct functioning of the product.\n- Add `README`.\n- Add a first implementation of a token airdrop whitelisting script (to be improved and redefined).\n- Add a `contentHash` field in the Job struct in the registry to allow describing the job through an IPFS-uploaded file.\n- Add works completed view function to the bonder.\n- Fixed source code verification errors on Rinkeby Etherescan.\n- Improve credit management and clean up code using a dedicated library.\n- Add possibility to upgrade a job.\n- Add possibility to remove credit from job.\n- Lock tokens added through liquidity sale, since users get a premium on that option. This avoids people selling their liquidity tokens for premium JOLT, and then withdrawing and selling the JOLT too, to farm value out of the platform.\n- Add works completed to requirements for jobs that need some proved worker reputation to be executed.\n- Allow to fetch all jobs added by a specific owner.\n- Add a boost to used gas when evaluating work, in order to account for external calls increasing the gas consumption (tradeoff between flexibility and cost of operation).\n\nI also started working on a frontend and SDK for the platform too towards the end of December. The repos are not currently public (I'm waiting for the product to go live before opening them to the public), so the proof will only be available in the future for this part.\n\n### DXdao token list\n\nI've added some tokens on Arbitrum Rinkeby.","title":"DAI payout (26/11/2021-26/12/2021) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmZ2ectMt2gDaB5ESmv6RqTzautLD4FVzKrQjpXk1BdUPt"},"0xf6445512b90411eee57781bf7729c9692f1bcd5a58da546f13d8558c98633477":{"description":"This proposal launches a SWPR/XDAI farming campaign that starts Thu Oct 28 2021 15:00 and ends Thu Nov 11 2021 15:00 and distributes 39,200 SWPR tokens over that time period.\n\nREP holders approved the SWPR token and farming campaigns through a[ signal proposal that passed in August](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x2d00135332c28271ba27c6f02f9aa79a480b4d7c58df37fb30e6a55353470910).

I had 3 weeks of vacation time in July and August, and then things got incredibly busy for me in August and September when there were issues with the Arbitrum launch that required redeployment of the governance base.  In that time frame I fell behind on keeping up with the forum and with my own worker proposals and things remained very busy through the October events in Portugal, and I am just now catching up.  Timely worker proposals are critical for the DAO to operate efficiently and I will make sure to prioritize them going forward, even when things may get busier.\n\n\n**Timeframe**\n\n- 7/1/21 - 8/31/21\n- 2 months\n\n**Things Accomplished**\n\n* During this time I organized the weekly dev calls with some support while I was on vacation.  \n\n* In this period I spent a good mount of time speaking to product teams in an effort to focus development activities on top priorities.\n\n* Coordinated with Aqua Squad on development plans and prioritization.\n\n* Helped coordinate Arbitrum launch plans and prepared for Arbitrum launch of Swapr and DXdao base.\n\n* Some early work and review on Carrot with Federico and Zett.\n\n* Started preparing Hats integration but got distracted by other priorities.\n\n* Some review of DXdocs.\n\n* Support in interviewing and onboarding of devs and other roles.\n\n* Talked on Twitter Spaces about DAOs on July 1st.\n\n* Recorded a podcast about DXdao with CryptoBreakdown\n\n* General duties like multisig transactions, security monitoring, governance, and participating in chat channels.  I try to stay on top of the communication channels as I feel its important for my role in helping coordination, though trying to refine my approach to this so that it doesn’t consume too much of my time.\n\n**Things not Accomplished**\n\n* Phil who had been doing auditing work for DXdao went dark, which prevented auditing work from moving forward during this time frame.\n\n* While I helped some with the review of DXdocs, I did not make much progress on helping with technical documentation.  The good news is newish team leads have been helping a lot here, but still would like to give this more time in the coming months.\n\n* Do not feel I made much progress during this period towards improving collaboration, review, and learning between squads.

This puts an excessive burden and cost on contributors. If a solution is at all available, it is likely to differ per each country. Moreover, it is increasingly difficult to find banks that will bank crypto funds for EU based companies. Making it tedious for contributors who use a company as a legal wrapper, to bank and access their funds.\n\n**Details**\n\nDevX AG is a Switzerland-based dev shop which connects web3 professionals with companies and facilitates payment between the parties. Switzerland is a crypto-fiendly, neutral and sovereign jurisdiction in the European Economic Area (EEA), with early adoption and clear guidelines from the regulatory authorities (FINMA) on crypto as well as a crypto-friendly banking industry.\n\nDevX AG is able to offer DXdao access to the off-chain world and FIAT without having to compromise on decentralization or the need to incorporate an entity. \n\nWhat DevX AG offers:\n\n* Access to EU market\n* FIAT payments\n* Engage in contractual relationships with third-parties (lawyers, auditors etc.)\n* Represent the interests of the DAO in case of contractual violations\n\nThis proposal sends an initial $100k to DevX AG. These funds shall be credited to DXdao - and accessible for DXdao to spend through on-chain proposals explicitly referencing that the payment shall be fulfilled by DevX AG.

The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.\n\nSince the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.\n\nIn August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.\n\nThe proposal commits DXdao to:\n\n\n\n* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD\n* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee\n* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom \n\nTo further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**\n\n## Details\n\n**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**\nThis proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:\n\n\n\n* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market \n* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets \n* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV\n* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD\n\n**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**\nManagement of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:\n\n\n\n* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD\n* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity\n* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions\n\n**Product development funding**\nDXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.\n\nThis % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. \n\nThis proposal commits to implement:\n\n\n\n* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)\n* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV\n* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:\n    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with \n    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and\n     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years\n* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury\n\n## Definition and clarifications\n\n\n\n* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly.\n* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.\n* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.\n* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.\n* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.\n\n\n### Meeting Links:\n - [DXD Token Meeting #1 (Sep 1)](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-token-working-group-kick-off-call/4494)\n - [DXD Token Meeting #2 (Sep 15)](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-token-wg-meeting-comparison-of-token-models-sep-15/4530)\n - [DXD Token Meeting #3 (Sep 29)](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-token-wg-meeting-3-dxd-token-models-sep-29/4562)\n - [DXD Token Meeting #4 (Nov 3)](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-token-wg-meeting-4-nov-3/4640)\n - [DXD Token Meeting #5 (Nov 17)](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-token-wg-meeting-5-nov-17/4704)","title":"Approve New DXD Token Model","hash":"QmNP4PR2CbhiU4Z4S2KF957dwLe1LUVpNWP6yDPewVzBB5"},"0xf7482625a479c38c5c380572e603630df7de0dc5907a347cb833821db0eccbd4":{"description":"I am creating this post as a draft proposal to amend the current [DXParis Contributor Stipend](https://daotalk.org/t/dxparis-contributor-stipend/4237).\n\nAfter receiving multiple requests from current DXdao contributors, I am proposing the following costs are adjusted on the DXParis Contributor stipend:\n\nTransportation - $500 Europe and $1400 US / Canada / Long-haul","title":"DXParis Contributor Stipend - Amendment","hash":"QmWRZSJdgF9kHs5G2gYVi7NW1wr4P1Yx5QB9AUK8MQdX2J"},"0xf752d6b2b1e58f4866903171024c532f73bc74c739f72590930d99a10b4c62a7":{"description":"This proposal sends 10.53 WETH to the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions) intended to be used to place an order to purchase xDXD in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was originally passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45), and extended through a further proposal which also passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x6f4bb1bb12469639b4af6f67ee04b174b07df211b3de45e6254de65082446af0) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x29842379fd0990415138b61b760e296059423fc35b3314f939573a4dd0aecbb3).

Caney Fork’s upcoming worker proposal [can be found on DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-oct-nov-2022/4585).\n\nWhat I did well: \n\n\n\n* DXdao in ENS - the [proposal to delegate DXdao’s 46k ENS tokens passed in mid-September](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xa7aaee0957c27f31fc936d92b2b6275c631935263f6c0368f5f095bf84a71200). This is important bc DXdao depends on ENS and it also begins the process of DXdao participating in other DAOs governance. In addition to the passing the delegation proposal, I also made a [post introducing DXdao in the ENS forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/dxdao-in-ens-dao/14628) as well as a [This Month in ENS](https://daotalk.org/t/this-month-in-ens-dao-september-2022/4592) post on DAOtalk. \n* [DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xebf720bfb4847b1b3caa63038bb7a2ff608a63b90217f8a05dd19a154828db51) - the proposal to establish the DXD Token WG passed on Aug 30, and so far there have been three meetings. This is ongoing and still A LOT to figure out, but I think the WG has been good at bringing in DXD holders into the conversation. Check out this [halfway checkin post](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-token-wg-midway-checkin/4593) for the latest.\n\nWhat I did okay:\n\n\n\n* DXD Buyback facilitation - I helped pass the [Authorize $500k of DXD buyback with new parameters](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x072519e7fa7d55619fcc675c5c47e446e499ee454da1f2b370825ac447d06758) at the end of August and the [DXD Trade Volume updates](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-trade-volume-update-sep-14/4542). We hit some roadblocks on executing the buyback and looks like we are finally putting GPv1 to bed and switching to Cow Protocol. \n* DXLegal Assessments - we are close to concluding these. I think it was great info and a great way to connect with knowledgeable Web3 lawyers. Only ‘okay’ bc received some feedback that perhaps this should have presented to a smaller group.\n* Month in Review and Operation Decentralization - still writing the Month in Review along with help from Keenan and Wayne ([July](https://dxdao.medium.com/dxdao-month-in-review-august-2022-b042eca747d7) and [August](https://dxdao.medium.com/dxdao-month-in-review-july-2022-c8d49b1492e4)). I think the quality is pretty consistent. I also hosted the first episode of Operation Decentralization in the middle of August, but still waiting for it to be published.\n\nWhat I did not do well at:\n\n\n\n* Budget - this was a major to do item for this worker proposal period. In July I posted a [2H2022 budget draft](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-budget-2h2022/4394) but the community wanted to move in a different direction. My efforts to get an overall budget passed has been superseded by the Alternative Restructuring and Refocus proposal, which has a three phase approach to find consensus on a budget. Looking forward to contributing to this conversation.\n* Maintaining composure - this was a tough two months at DXdao with lots of emotional conversations. The process of governance can be messy and it’s hard to be both a participant in governance, where I have opinions and preferences, and a facilitator of governance, where I am supposed to be credibly neutral. I don’t have any easy answers to this, but acknowledge that I have things to work on.\n\nSeptember compensation\n\n\n\n* $8,100 in USDC/Dai\n* $8,550 in DXD, using 30 day average for DXD price or minimum $523, vested for 3 years with one year cliff\n* 0.1667% mainnet REP or 3631 REP","title":"Caney Fork Worker Proposal Aug/Sept 2022 (2/2)","hash":"QmQWgxZ1847RBnjeJFusFfsERK8xzgnN1BSoNn6XEjD2Kc"},"0xf7715dc7ba4239085e913e1d0f6246f48eeb9cbdce779a7ed35f1908d70c654f":{"description":"**Background:**\n\nI have been working as a full-stack JavaScript developer for the last 4 years for both small startups and big companies like JP Morgan or Lexis Nexis.

This proposal places an order for 10.52 WETH using a [$3756.41 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was originally passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45), and extended for another $1m to $3m total, through a further proposal which also passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x56c66f99d87a48d707475aa2466f0a58da13bd744475410957d6572b439cc5bf). The extension on the buyback program was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/extend-dxd-buyback-program-for-another-1m-draft-proposal/3319). \n\nThis proposal would place a limit order on the Gnosis Protocol at a price that is 3% above the time-weighted average price of xDXD/WETH on Swapr when the proposal is executed and the [Oracle contract is called](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xFbAc9467FCcb14394860A9E280E2FBabCBbc8DD2/transactions). The 3% slippage tolerance is under the parameters approved in the [DXD Buyback Program Parameters Update #1](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153) proposal that passed on [mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xd6c4bfd03d87c365432c073ff0f36578c3cba9da080b75de5058357319908039). The order requires 50 WETH in the Swapr xDXD/WETH pool when the oracle checks and has a minimum amount of DXD accepted of 35 DXD. The order is live until Thu Feb 03 2022 18:38:22 GMT.\n\nFurther explanation of the [GP relayer can be found here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdGAjyrpjobow8Hv3fCPoLd5LYRYZPB9qnAWSaRc5krNP). \n\nGiven [the DXD price](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dxdao) and the value of ETH in [DXdao’s treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a), this proposal abides by the DXD Buyback Program, which was passed on [mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45) and discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-program-signal-proposal/2890).","title":"xDXD Buyback Order #103 for 10.52 WETH","hash":"QmcFk8ibAVqJZhnKwafGEW5J1NLejDRoCKF5Jadaq8azee"},"0xf9b2444ad27547994905aaa9bfd5e89ce8ba6badac940a087d90757e5d4394a3":{"description":"int_blue Retrospective October - November, Creative Director\nRecap:\nThe highlights of October and November were for sure DEVCON Bogota, beeing part of Infinite hackathon and the dxDAO retreat in Cartagena.

Denver should be an important time for the team with lots of us here together and a lot of things to discuss around gov 2.0 implementation and the audit interim report as well as generally improving the development workflow for smart contracts.\n\nHopefully over this next worker period we will have the opportunity to test and fully prepare for the eventual audit report and SWPR launch.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n* Help oversee the fixes and full audit of DXvote contracts\n* Have users test and provide feedback on guilds\n* Use guilds for a few testing use cases (ms replacement, initiative dao etc)\n* Depending on audit progress, release swpr guild (if audit not ready then at least be ready with development work)\n* Begin work on the next part of the 2022 roadmap - DXvote 1.1 starting refactor and major redesigns to match the guild level of UX in our main governance application\n* Onboarding new developers and allowing for current developers to continue growing and honing their craft on DXgov\n* Further spread discussion and awareness on what DXgov is doing - EthDenver and beyond\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n* Manage releases and cache updates for DXgov products\n* Balancing project lead responsibilities with development work\n* Leading DXvote calls and representing the project in DXdao calls\n* Moving DXvote product development in the right direction according to roadmap and requirements\n* Limit bugs and production problems as much as possible\n* Coordinating between different teams in DXdao for guilds and feature requests, etc\n* Managing project and sprints to ensure the team is moving forward in the most efficient and prioritised way to deliver our goals\n* Constant discussion and thinking through what certain decisions could mean for gov 2.0 and the governance dynamic after&during release\n* Taking an overall large part in the direction of DXdao\n\n**Reflection on last worker period:**\n\nAs expected the last worker period of mine was a little bit of an interesting time. We of course had the holidays which I was mostly working over and then I spent a lot of time moving to Lisbon.\n\n**Did well:**\n\n* Keeping up with everything - Despite having a busy time moving countries I think I still did a decent job of keeping on top of all my usual tasks and dont think much was really affected as I found time to work at close to my usual hours\n* Taking a break - With moving to Lisbon my girlfriend also had a chance to come over to visit and have not seen her in over a year I took a week off. I was glad to be able to actually keep myself away from work and since I put more work in the previous week everything was prepared for DXgov to continue working smoothly.\n* Progress on guilds - I’m really pleased with how work is continuing on guilds and we made a lot of leaps in this time period. We went through a few iterations of ..\n* Recap presentation -\n* Documentation - Although not live as of right now, there will be a large update to DXdocs soon that will include a large amount of DXgov documentation which I spent a good amount of time compiling. This should act as a good resource to point community members to as well as helping faster onboard new contributors to the DXgov team.\n* DXgov esports - Although Dave did all the heavy lifting with this it was nice to be along for the ride and help brainstorm the huge potential the Copenhagen flames sponsorship\n* Finally, after it being a note in my proposals for essentially the entirety of my time at DXdao, I finally have made a merged change into some smart contracts. Although I have actually been gaining a lot of confidence in solidity simply by understanding guilds and the governance contracts, actually writing changes was a good way of putting it into practice and hopefully, I can do some more changes to come.\n\n**Did ok:**\n\n* DXvote maintenance - We have kept up with fairly regular updates and releases to DXvote despite it not being the main focus of most of the team whilst guilds have been in development. There have still been a few bugs and issues occurring but I think they have been relatively well dealt with all things considered. However, I am looking forward to having guilds shipped and being able to allocate more resources to DXvote 1.1.\n\n**Could have done better:**\n\n* I'm sad we weren't able to do much to be able to help Lulli stay contributing to DXgov as he is an amazing developer but hopefully he will be able to return in a few months.\n* Wallet schemes - The ongoing saga of getting wallet schemes working on xdai has been a somewhat tiring one with a good few bumps along the way. Due to the timing of the interim audit report, we have decided to further postpone the use of the new architecture on gnosis chain since it will need redeployment once issues have been addressed. Not without benefit though, this experience has raised a lot of problems with our development process that we will soon be fixing.\n\n**Timeframe**: 2 months\n\n**Compensation**: Level 6\n\n**Salary** -\n1st month - 4 days off after Denver 85% (-1 day a month holiday)\n$6800 DAI\n9.75 DXD\n0.142% REP\n\n2nd month:\n$8000 DAI\n$6000 DXD\n0.1667% REP","title":"Ross Neilson Worker Proposal 18/2/2022-18/4/2022 - Start","hash":"QmQoAeKJ8NpXDxGLunCkRC85kvSDTy6aaUJBNUnZq3ygii"},"0xfa21c90ad70a9f2f804246f3746b5aef5036864f29158c298efe49a28d6578f3":{"description":"<!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! -->\n\nBelow is a scope of work to be done from April 1, 2022 - May 31st, 2022 for Caney Fork LLC.

COW/WETH pool made our gnosis chain Swapr see new records of daily and weekly volume. We averaged $32m first day.\nWe had a couple of hiccups during this time.\n\n1. Carrot Campaign link didn't take you to any campaign and redirected you to the landing page of carrot. This is because carrot.eth was not updated with the latest versions which were running the campaigns.\n\n2. Deposit/withdrawals during the high volatility of COW/WETH was almost impossible and we don't have the tools to help our users to make it easier. \n\n   ![image|690x490](upload://h1XQhjKJiFlqJxSBZyYxBXcSknM.png)\n\n   Our solution would be to add a slippage settings to deposit/withdraw.\n   \n   ![image|690x242, 75%](upload://vwQNJvSWQ9OQrgC3SK58nJB1Nqs.jpeg)\n\n3. Swapr.eth.link was down most of the time(and still is at the time of writing). This is something we don't have control over. We made an effort to see if this from our side and optimized a lot of things. The dapp is still down on eth.link. We have started to the process to start asking people to visit swapr.eth.limo instead and changed our links on our social media. .eth.limo is much more reliable and is almost never down. We want to make an effort talking to ENS guys and cloudflare to see what the future of .eth.link will be.\n\n#### DIY Farming 1.2\nDIY farming page has been redesigning to fit the new design of swapr. We have also rearranged the flow to suit the features we are building. Here is the design (still work in progress) below and we plan to have this ready during Q2.\n\n![image|297x500, 100%](upload://quEXaL3rFXhaJMsKw6q2e7gRU4n.jpeg)\n\n#### Improved Swap Box \nCurrently Being reviewed and will be released with Swapr Beta 12.

See the [original post Worker proposal](https://daotalk.org/t/draft-worker-proposal-adam-azad-q1-2021/2659)\n\nThis proposal requests a trial proposal and worker. To save on gas, once this clears DAOtalk, I will submit a proposal requesting 1.5 months payments; 14 days trial, and 1-month work. \n\n# Background\n\nMy name is Adam. A Full Stack Engineer with 4 years of experience. I have worked remotely with studios from Canada, Europe, and SE Asia.\n\nMy involvement in crypto goes back to 2012 when I accumulated my first Bitcoin through a platform, named CoinUrl, that paid for placing ads on the website in Bitcoin. I used CoinUrl on my first online startup. In mid-2017, I started mining Ethereum with one AMD RX 480 at my university. I then scaled it to a fleet of 19 GPUs.\n\nI also am active in DeFi as an investor and builder and getting my hands dirty with Solidity. 😊\n\nI bring experience from my software development and passion for working in the DeFi and blockchain space. It is my secret ingredient (don't tell others my secret )\n\nYou will find my past work/projects at [https://adamazad.com/work](https://adamazad.com/work) and [https://github.com/adamazad](https://github.com/adamazad). I am also working on [Kryptobase](https://kryptoba.se/) which is a mobile app to buy crypto in Iraqi Kurdistan. We plan to use an AMM (supposedly Uniswap or Swapr) under the hood and submit orders on behalf of our users.\n\n# Resume\n\nAn up-to-date version is available at [https://adamazad.com/resume](https://adamazad.com/resume) \n\n# Trial Objectives\n\nThe first call was with Martin Krung, in which he introduced Mesa, its history, and the next vision for Mesa for Q1-Q2 2021. As it stands, Mesa's brand is to be used as a new IDO platform. Mesa will use [gnosis/ido-contracts](https://github.com/gnosis/ido-contracts), provided that both DXdao and Gnosis come to a cooperative agreement. Otherwise, Nico will write the contracts from scratch.\n\n### Mesa Prototype\n\nGiven that the trial is only 2 weeks, and the product roadmap Martin laid out in [Mesa Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=1158278892), we will only focus on delivering an ~~MVP~~ prototype frontend. \n\n- [`prototype` branch](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/commits?author=adamazad)\n- [PRs against the `main` branch](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aadamazad+is%3Aclosed)\n\n\n# Timeframe\n\n**Start date:** Jan 13th, 2021\n\n**End date:** Jan 27th, 2021 \n\n**Total:** 14 days.\n\n**Hours:** 40/week\n\n## Compensation\n\n### Trial period, 2 weeks, 50% rate\n\n- Level 3\n\n- Full-time: 40 hours/week\n\n- DAI: $1,500 (25% of $6,000)\n\n- DXD: $1,000 (25% of $4,000):\n\n    - $500 (DXD) vested after a 1-year cliff, and\n\n    - the remaining $500 (DXD) after the first year on a linear schedule.\n- REP: 0.041675% (25% of 0.1667%)","title":"Trial Worker Proposal - Adam Azad - January 13-27th, 2021","hash":"QmQQK6286ksPTU2rnbVc3JCRZ5y33udc2hisGrwHzDEdjx"},"0xfcbd7851bfb1b97ef5684a0bc0840eeecac35d3f72227ee539602c68794e9f38":{"description":": I 0xSpicySoup am requesting\nREP in relation to my DXdao Discord participation level.

In conjunction with the payment structure update, I met 1:1 with all DXdao contributors to discuss the new structure and assisted with transitioning them into the new structure. I also collaborated with the DXgov team on the payment structure updates to DXvote.\n\nIn January, the ContributorX began to shift a lot of focus on recruiting. Working alongside @keenanluke we helped to source, recruit, interview and bring on a new member to DXvoice as a Social Media and Community growth manager.\n\nSupported @allyq in the implementationof our first peer review at DXdao. I am looking forward to continuing this initiative moving forward at DXdao.\n\nNeeds improvement:\n\nIn the upcoming months I want to focus more on strategy and processes around improving sourcing and recruiting contributors to DXdao.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\nThis proposal falls under the new compensation structure 2 enacted from 01/01/2022.

With so much to do here, I really had a hard time finding the time to sit down and write this content. I am working in that organization as I understand the importance of being able to do it on time and I am confident that over time this will become a more fluid habit.\n\n---\n\n**Last period review:**\n\n### Contributions\n\n- *[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/641](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/641)*\n- *[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/662](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/662)*\n- *[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/666](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/666)*\n- *[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/710](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/710)*\n- *[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/716](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/716)*\n- *[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/729](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/729)*\n- *[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/734](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/734)*\n- *[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/757](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/757)*\n- *[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/764](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/764)*\n- *[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/105](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/105)*\n\n### What went well:\n\n- It was great to meet the team in Denver, especially to know who I will be working with and to learn more about the values that dxDao represents. Being my first event, I got the impression that there were not many projects that carried the flag of decentralization as seriously as dxDao, I felt glad to be a part of the project.\n- Dev script (Augusto’s contribution) was a great addition. I would say that applying the integration tests (cypress) with our local development script was good although there is much more to do. In my opinion, we should put in more time performing E2E tests once the script is \"finished” and when we reach some stability in the guild’s code. Also, doing cypress/metamask integration would be ideal to fully test our platform.\n- I started working on some smart contract issues, and I believe that is a huge win on a personal level. Furthermore, it is great for the team to start taking action to avoid relying on a single person to work in that area.\n- Guild’s contributions were good. I worked on some UI aspects of the create-proposal flow for guilds. On top of that, I started working on “guild implementation support epic\" to provide different views/actions for different types of guilds.\n- Being full-time here represents a great victory on a personal level and I am very happy to have taken that step. I hope to be able to contribute more and better over time.\n\n### What could be improved:\n\n- I consider that I still need to find time to participate more in the DAO by attending the meetings, and reading and voting proposals. For the moment, I have been very focused on my tasks and dxvote team meetings. I also still need to get used to writing down my proposals on time. It is something I still have to get used to, and I’m trying to find the space and organize myself to accomplish it.\n- During this period the contributions/code-reviews balance was ok but I know can be better.\n\n---\n\n# Goals:\n\n- Collaborate with the DXGov team on the DXVote project and guilds MVP\n- Work on \"Guild implementation support epic\" to support different types of guilds/features\n- Work on any issue(s) and/or feature(s) that the team leader sees fit for me.\n- Continue learning more about web3 and solidity development in general\n- Continue contributing to the dxdao-contracts repo, increasing the coverage of the tests, and working on the issues of the audit report.\n- Now that e2e tests (cypress) are working with the development script, I would like to spend some time researching/implementing the interaction between cypress and metamask to be able to fully test guilds with on-chain actions (create-proposal, vote, etc)\n\n# Responsibilities:\n\nCollaborate with the dxgov team to build Guilds MVP and support dxvote\n\n# Timeframe:\n\n2 months.

Cost first 50% $6667.82, estimated completion is the third week of July 2021.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the coming months, Omen will launch the Omen Guild and launch the genesis of the OMN token. The purpose of this launch is to increase the community of prediction market enthusiasts that govern and participate in Omen.\n\nThough prediction markets have been around for a couple of years, how they function and their basic use case is still novel to a vast majority of the DeFi and crypto communities.\n\nProposal\n\nDXdao has received a quote from Ilio 1, a design studio with a focus on motion design. Ilio has worked with other crypto and fintech projects before and is available in approximately two weeks to start work on a 60-second video animation that explains the vision of Omen. The project will be completed by the third week of July.\n\n@pulpmachina initially found Ilio and requested a quote for the Omen video project, and, for the past month, I’ve been in communication with Ilio regarding the video. With the assistance of @corkus, I will be coordinating with Ilio to explain what we’d like to have in the video to describe how Omen works as a prediction market and the potential of Omen in the prediction market space.\n\nCost\n\nTh invoice for the video project is **10980 €**. At time of writing (6.13.21), the conversion rate to USD is **$13295.63** (Source: [google](https://www.google.com/search?q=10980+euros+to+USD&rlz=1C5CHFA_enES928ES928&oq=10980+euros+to+USD&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30j0i390l4.10769j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8))\n\nSo, in order to start work, Ilio needs to receive the first 50% payment for the video, approximately **$6,647.82 USD.**\n\nThis proposal therefore requests the first 50% of the funding -- $6647.82 + $20 for international wire fee charges. Total = **$6667.82.** \n\nI will request the second payment near the completion of the project with a second on-chain proposal in mid-July 2021 for the same amount, subject to Euro / USD conversion rate changes. \n\nFor reference, here is the daotalk.org signal proposal post: https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-to-fund-omen-marketing-video/3015 . \nI will also update this post with the corrected amount requested.

We’ve created memorable brands and experiences for Fortune 100 companies to local breweries to DeFi startups.\n\nWe are big believers in the power of prediction markets and have previous experience designing a Futarchy based app for a DAO. This is why the opportunity to design and build a website for Omen is very exciting for us!\n\n**Project Description**\nProduct strategy, design and build of a new Omen marketing website and various marketing collateral.\n\n**Overview - Strategy**\nOur job is to design the Omen website while aligning it with your product goals and your customers needs. This is where we dig into the value proposition of Omen and how the website communicates this in a way that resonates with your users and leaves a lasting impression.\n\n**Complete Website Design - 2-4 Pages**\nComplete web design for 2-4 pages of the Omen website. We’ll collaborate with the team at DXDao to extend the brand of Omen with good copywriting and messaging, We’ll curate photography, icons and create custom illustrations if needed at this point too.\n\n**Website Development - 2-4 pages**\nWe will build 2-4 static pages for both mobile and desktop. The actual pages will be determined in a discovery session and as the project evolves. This is meant to be enough pages to give the Omen website a foundation to build from in the future.\n\n**Marketing Banners - Design, Development & Animation - 5 Figma Templates**\nWe will design, animate and build 3-4 static and animated banners at various sizes for use on Omen’s Twitter and Medium posts delivered as Figma files.\nThe banners will consist of:\n\nStatic banner templates (1 unique design per concept below - 4 total)\n\nBanner to highlight popular/interesting categorical or scalar markets.\nBanner for when a new Omen Version has been proposed and approved by the DXdao.\nBanner to highlight the current rewards (in Omen token) for liquidity providers of an omen market.\nBanner that shows the approval of liquidity rewards by the Guild\nAnimated banner template (1 unique design and loopable animation)\n\nAnimated banner template highlighting popular/interesting categorical or scalar markets. (title, scalar visualization, current winning value)\n\n**Timeline**\n7-9 Weeks\n\nEstimated Start Date of August 2, 2021. If there are any changes in the scheduled start this will be communicated to the team at DXDao.\n\n**Compensation**\nProfessional fees for the new website and marketing banners would be $28,500 USD for the projects outlined above.\n\nWe are very interested in contributing to the Omen project and feel the project as a whole could benefit if our interests were aligned. We are open to being partially compensated with OMN token team rewards. We propose a split of 1/2 in xDai and 1/2 in OMN token.\n\nThis proposal includes the design, copywriting, icons, illustrations, Figma source files, animations and build of a new marketing website.\n\n**Payment**\n\n1/2 xDai portion (3 payments to be executed in 3 separate contracts):\n\n50% of the 1/2 xDai value at the budget’s approval ($7,125 xDai) upon\nthe beginning of the project.\n25% of the 1/2 xDai at the beginning of web development ($3,562.50 xDai).\nRemaining 25% of the 1/2 USD ($3,562.50 xDai) upon launch of the website or delivery of the marketing banners – whichever comes last.\n\n**OMN Token Payment**\n1/2 OMN Token equal to $14,250 xDai at a to be determined valuation. The contract will be executed on a separate vesting contract following a 9 month vesting schedule.\n\n**Web Hosting**\nThe budget does not include the cost of the domain or hosting (web hosting). We build all websites in Webflow and host the websites with them as well. Web hosting is typically around $25-$30/month. DXdao has the option to pay for the hosting on a monthly basis or Hunter Design Co. can invoice DXDao every month for the web hosting.\n\n**Bug Free Guarantee**\nHunter Design Co. has a 1 year bug-free guarantee. If at any time a bug is found one year within launch of the website we will fix it.

After discussion with relevant contributors and considering my reviews from the new review program, I will be posting this proposal at level 7. My responsibility pool including leadership tasks, to me, fairly put me within the bounds of level 7. Although personally, I would consider myself freshly within this level, and I believe I still have lots of room for personal growth and time before considering any further adjustments. This comes on the tail end of 0xKLOM.eth transitioning to level 5 on the original compensation guidelines. \n\n* Experience Level: 7\n* Full-time.\n* Month one.\n  * $9,000 (xDai) + $81 (xDai).\n  * $7,500 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n  * 0.1667% REP.\n* Month two.\n  * $9,000 (xDai) + $81 (xDai).\n  * $7,500 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n  * 0.1667% REP.\n\n$81 accounts for the previously specified $36 monthly community tool costs (statbot, yagpdb, etc…), as well as $45 monthly expenditure of Discord boosts to attain level 2 (Better audio quality, banner, community server status, etc). Although these community costs are still small, I would like to transition these to either their own proposal or the multi-sig as the costs grow - bonus benefit of deeper accountability and a trail that can be followed if I were to disappear. \n\n**This proposal will request Month one’s xDai at the beginning of the period.** The second proposal will request Month two’s xDai, and 0.3334% mainnet REP on GC at the end of the period. The second proposal will also specify owed % of mainnet REP, and owed DXD based on average price over the final month on Swapr provided it is above $523, otherwise $523 will be used.","title":"0xKLOM.eth Contributor Proposal for 01/2022 to 03/2022 1/2","hash":"QmWf3sx6odX8ANU55LF1nFsP48vTsBjFCacP7oUXhdSJJ1"},"0x91305cc858cf44cd44f03f06032bdcde322fcadbe3a761fdd727d3323ca5fbca":{"description":"### Hello Everyone,\n\nThis is the second part of this proposal, but I will only be claiming the REP at this time.\n\nI will collect the xDAI payment when I can do this through DevX.\n\n===== Original Proposal starts below =====\n\nAnother two months have flown by, and what an amazing two months it has been. There were many personal highlights and milestones for me during this period. I officially finished working at my “9-5er” and joined DXdao as a full time contributor, cementing my fall DAOn the rabbit hole! This granted me the opportunity to devote all my “thinking” time to DXdao and how I can contribute and add value (while proofreading, I wanted to change devote into DXvote :laughing: - shows how much I have been DXdao’d!)\n\nOn top of all the professional growth, I was given the opportunity to attend ETHAmsterdam which was another milestone in my web3 journey. Definitely on par with finding DXdao for the first time. Meeting the contributors, whom I had only spoken to on calls and heard in meetings, irl was just plain fantastic and will remain with me always!\n\nFrom a personal point of view: the meeting, talking, having dinners and getting to know one another was totally humanizing and heartwarming, and I enjoyed every minute. From a professional point of view, seeing the contributors in action both on and off the stage was awesome! I learnt so much from them about how to interact with other attendees and how to present DXdao. It is difficult to quantify all the subtle lessons here, but in a nutshell, for me the ETHAmsterdam experience was invaluable and unforgettable from both the personal and professional aspect.\n\nWhen I look back and reflect on the past two months I can only be grateful. I am super excited for what the next two months will hold as I further delve into all things DXdao and web3. It is difficult for me to comprehend that it has only been 4.5 months since starting with DXdao.\n\nThank you all once again and as always I welcome any feedback, notes or criticism.\n\n**Role:**\n\nSocial Media and Community Growth Contributor\n\n**Time frame:**\n\n2 Month Period - 31.05.2022 - 25.07.2022 (40 hours/week)\n\n## Reflection on goals and responsibilities:\n\n### What I think I did well in relation to my goals:\n\n*1. Improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products and services.*\n\nI am happy with the increase of my knowledge in this regard. While I still have lots to learn I no longer feel like I am fumbling around in the dark.\n\n*2. Continue clarifying existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities and take them on as my “own”.*\n\nIn the past two months I made a point of identifying as many aspects of DXdao’s operations that fall within the community notification framework to ensure that I take “ownership” of these. To make sure the correct information goes out in a timely manner. While there is still work to be done in this area, progress has been good and systems are being created and falling into place.\n\n*3. Get to know the remaining key contributors that I have not yet met.*\n\nI have gotten to know more contributors and ETHAmsterdam helped a lot with this. I will continue to slowly introduce myself to the community and make contact.\n\n### What I think I did well in relation to my Responsibilities:\n\n*1. Continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere:*\n\nTweets have been coming out in a consistent and timely manner. Quality has been good with an added focus on highlighting the efforts of contributors who represent/ed DXdao in a public manner.\n\n*2. Social Engagement:*\n\nBetween my activity on Twitter, Medium and at ETHAmsterdam I think that I have been part of the collective that has helped increase the awareness of DXdao and its products. I would also add that while I did this for the public, I picked up a whole lot of knowledge and awareness for myself at the same time.\n\n*3. Communications:*\n\nI think there has been solid activity and execution on content across Twitter, Medium and Discord.\n\n### What I think needs improvement in relation to my Responsibilities\n\n*1. Continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere.*\n\n*The Social Highlights program:* I have not explored the social highlights program fully. This still needs attention and I will look at allocating time to it during this contributor time frame.\n\n*1:10 post to engagement ratio:* This happens, but not as consistently as I would like and I need to clarify certain elements of this. This still needs attention and I will look at allocating time to it as well.\n\nWhile I have not addressed these two elements fully up to this point, as my systems of operations fall into place I foresee time freeing up, and organizing these will be on the top of the list to tackle.\n\n*2. Social Engagement:*\n\n* I still have to analyze competitors, complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on Twitter. I hope to allocate time to this, depending on urgency and priority.\n\n* While I have created content, it has been part of the ongoing events and affairs of DXdao. I have spent some time thinking about where I can add value in developing additional content, but not taken strong actionable steps yet. I will look to nail down a topic and formulate an actionable plan and system during this period.\n\n*3. Growth Marketing:*\n\nAgain during this period I only briefly looked at metrics at times to see how things were going during certain times. This needs more time and I will be looking at discussing this more with @KeenanL, especially as this aligns with the DXvoice Budget and KPIs.\n\n### Some thoughts:\n\nI realize now more than ever that things move at lightning speed in web3. I get a sense that things are changing in DXdao. With the increase in developer power, upcoming release of guilds, Arbitrum Odyssey, Carrot v1 and two major conferences ahead to name but a few, it is clear that DXdao is shifting into a higher gear. This is going to bring many opportunities and challenges and I aim to do my part in helping the collective deal with the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities.\n\nI think that as I achieve my goals and fulfill my responsibilities I will be able to provide the communication systems DXdao requires to inform the community in a fashion that is both fun and informative.\n\n### Goals:\n\n1. Continue to improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products and services. (By the look of things, this will become a rolling goal as things change so fast, and there will always be something new to learn).\n2. Continue clarifying existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities and take them on as my “own”.\n3. Get to know contributors that I have not yet met.\n\n### Responsibilities:\n\n**Continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere.**\n\n* The Social Highlights Program: Clarify, update if need be and implement.\n\n* The application of the 1:10 post to engagement ratio: clarify and implement.\n\n**Social Engagement:**\n\n* Identify and analyze competitors, complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on Twitter and Discord.\n* Help increase awareness of DXdao and its products, and drive social engagement with the relevant DXdao Twitter accounts.\n* Explore DXdao history and future to assist in developing a content generating strategy to add to mediums deemed acceptable by DXdao.\n\n**Growth Marketing:**\n\n* Analyze data and track metrics of tweets to determine what is working and what is not and to optimize tweets according to target audience.\n\n**Communications:**\n\n* Assist with ideating and executing campaigns across owned and other media channels as my awareness and knowledge grows.\n\n### Previous proposals:\n\n[25.01.2022 - 04.04.2022: 2.5 month Trial period](https://daotalk.org/t/waynes-worker-proposal-trial-period-late-jan-2022-to-early-april-2022/3939/7)\n[05.04.2022 - 30.05.2022](https://daotalk.org/t/waynes-worker-proposal-early-april-2022-late-may-2022/4029#what-i-think-needs-improvement-5)\n\n### Compensation:\n\nThis compensation proposal is being submitted in accordance with the current[ DXdao Worker Guidelines](https://dxdocs.eth.link/docs/ContributorHub/contributor-onboarding/) and the current[ DXdao Pay Structure](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/xdai/proposal/0xd891621300fb5cd46a7962787f4d2fa85998bfb5524aae4b1784a620c562fdae)\n\nI have previously stated that I believe my past experience places me within all the levels 1-4, primarily 3 & 4. When starting at DXdao I volunteered to start my contribution at level 3 as a show of good faith, to prove that I have a work ethic in line with that which is expected at DXdao. I have worked the past 4.5 months at that level and after discussion with my squad lead @KeenanL, he agrees that I have delivered on my promises and that I now also more thoroughly fit within the level 4 of the contributor pay structure.

It was a busy period for the ContributorX, this is what went well, was just okay, and needs improvement.\n\n**What went well**\n\nWe completed our second contributor feedback review during this period. Providing consistent and constructive feedback is essential when working within a DAO and has always been a challenge for us. I am excited to say that we are starting to make progress on tackling this challenge through the implementation of our own contributor review process. During this recent contributor review, we found that contributors finished this review with ease and more thoroughly than the first. We implemented a few changes that would add great value to the review like the addition of the self-evaluation. At the moment, I can’t say that our feedback review system is perfect, but we are constantly working to improve this process to help ensure our contributors are getting the appropriate feedback they need to succeed within DXdao. Big thank you to @allyq for taking the lead on developing and distributing the content for this review \nAnother initiative completed during this period was Epoch 2 of AppreciationDAO using Coordinape. As expected, we had complete participation from our DXdao contributors and it was a great way for our core contributors to show our appreciation for one another. It is also always good to use new and innovative DAO tools to reward and incentivize our contributors. We hope to continue the use of Coordinape in the upcoming years.\n\nAlso, ETHCC was this period! Meeting contributors face-to-face is always beneficial. We attended many side events and even had our own with Gnosis Chain, GitPOAP and SAFE - DAOs and Builders à Paris. And of course, I’ll save the best last, participating and engaging with web3 enthusiasts in Paris for our Swapr awareness campaign! Looking forward to planning and seeing everyone in October for the Infinite Hackathon, Devcon and DXretreat!\n\n**\nWhat was just okay\n**\n\nWe made progress on finding the next DAO Counsel at DXdao. However, we have not identified one contributor who will be our next DAO Counsel yet. This process has been lengthy but we want to ensure we onboard the best candidate/s possible. Currently, there are three candidates completing a DXLegal assignment which can be found here. With the support of @Powers and @dlabs I believe we will have the next DAO Counsel on board by next period.\n\n**Could have been better**\n\nAt the beginning of this period, I worked alongside @ross to try and recruit a new Senior Web3 Developer for the Gov squad. Unfortunately, after screening hundreds of candidates and interviewing many we were not able to successfully onboard one. Multiple reasons could be attributed to the lack of finding a candidate, whether it was the market turn, timing, summer season, etc. We were not able to onboard a candidate but many lessons were learned during this interview and screening process.\n\nCompensation:\n\n- Level 6\n- Time commitment 100%\n- Contributing to DXdao since 3/22/2021\n- Full-time for total of 40 hours per week, for two months (8/1/2022-9/30/2022)\n\nMonth 1\n\n- $8,000 (xDAI)\n- $6,000 (DXD).

This was discussed on [DAOTalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/adjust-swpr-ens-liquidity-discount-multiplier-contribution-to-treasury-nav/4924).\n\n\n### Background\n\nLast December, DXdao [approved a new token model](https://alchemy.3ac.vc/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xb7ff31ec2bcdb8a254b8a1b06c6d2080a4089135b03ed55e684fd41b5176d946) which ties the value of DXD to the value of DXdao’s treasury. Since then, 9,500 DXD has been acquired by DXdao through [buyback purchases and member redemption balancers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17gI7_3RmWWkwVJ7_zKLi6ftUcJy4cqkNpoGCmt8IOIA/edit#gid=851060356).\n\nOne of the issues identified in [January’s DXD Monetary Policy Committee Meeting](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-monetary-policy-committee-monthly-january-26-16-00-utc/4854/3) was the increase in treasury contributions from non-core assets. The Treasury NAV is calculated across all assets in DXdao’s treasury - with certain assets’ contribution discounted - but the buybacks and member balancer redemptions are only using stablecoins and ETH, so this naturally increases no-core assets’ contribution to NAV.\n\nDXdao has 78m SWPR in its treasury and affiliated addresses. It currently has a liquidity weight of 25% because SWPR liquidity is low. A $750 purchase of SWPR token incurs 5% slippage.\n\nENS token, meanwhile, is using a 25% liquidity weight ratio as it was originally awarded to DXdao to help govern ENS and was not intended to be a capital base.\n\n\n### Details\n\nThis proposal authorizes the SWPR liquidity discount multiplier to be lowered to 10% and the ENS liquidity discount multiplier to be raised to 50% for all future Treasury NAV calculations.\n\n\n### Risks & other considerations\n\nThis will have a direct impact on the 70% of NAV price that DXdao supports through buybacks and member balancer redemptions. Even with the liquidity discount, the SWPR token is still susceptible to manipulation to inflate Treasury NAV given its low liquidity. Raising the ENS liquidity discount multiplier will make it more likely that some may need to be sold to balance the treasury.","title":" Adjust SWPR & ENS Treasury NAV Liquidity Weight Ratio","hash":"QmQb5yXc1WM31DBiTrLSe2vbVMN3CQLgsoAHSg36eGWvvi"},"0xc195fbbe2a861aa9377d08a5afcf2c46c81545cd8278e647f187e1f0981bd6ef":{"description":"\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

What holding me back was first not having the legal entity ready, but that's now in place for 2 months.\n\nEnd of May I worked 6 months for the DXdao. I was quite euphoric at the start and learned a lot during this time.\n\nWhat I have achieved, thanks to the mesa team. \n\n- I was able to bootstrap a new product from scratch by assembling a team, mostly by myself, except nico/sky, to develop a vision and execute on this vision.\n- We built a framework for IDOs which is adaptive and can be a neutral platform for a range of needs.\n- Mesa has the potential to grow in different directions and has a solid, but flexible architecture.\n- Software quality is good in the sens that we have a high test coverage and can replicate development environment fully of-chain with all component, this allows us to innovate/adapt quickly.\n\n\n\n**My goal is to bring Mesa as close as possible to this**:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cncol7d.png)\n\nScroll down to see the reality of building products [:arrow_down:](#Reality-of-building-a-product)\n\n\n# Nov/December 2020 \n\nFirst Working Proposal, 1 month,  24.11 - 24.12\n\nhttps://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-martin-krung-24-11-24-12/2363\n\n\n## Responsibilities (from my first proposal)\n\nProduct Owner/Manager for Mesa\nCoordination work on Mesa UX with devs/UX Design\nProvide feedback for Mesa on the gitcoin hackathon https://github.com/dxdaohackathon/dex-react/issues/1\nCoordination with gnosis about further development gnosis protocol\nEmbed Mesa in an overall product strategy\nConsult on projects doing IDO\nCollect feedback from projects doing IDOs and end-user\nReporting back to DXdao\nResearch on competing protocols\nTake part in bizDev\nOn-board new workers for mesa IDO\n\n##  Reflection about Responsibilities \n\nMy responsibilities are mostly still the same. I will adjust this in my formal forward-looking proposal. (Which will start 1. June, link to new proposal)\n\n\n## Goals this month (Nov/December 2020)\n\nFrom my first proposal: https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-martin-krung-24-11-24-12/2363\n\n## Reflection about the **Goals this month** \n\n\n### Develop a strategy/roadmap for Mesa IDO \n\n* Mesa Roadmap December 2020: https://hackmd.io/v8eO2cGhTCWD0YhjeGYXYg\n* Schedule, December 2020:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=1158278892\n* Mesa Roadmap as Chart, December 2020: https://www.figma.com/file/yL8VJ1KR0pzlEx6NXIUeQD/Mesa-Architecture?node-id=0%3A1\n\n\n### Make personas and user stories for Mesa IDO \n\n(Not formally done, but my talk with several possible clients and thinking at my experience on the investor side)\n\n* I talked to thomas from artis/minerva, learning there: it may be worth to have a mobile wallet like minerva to give noobs the opportunity to invest. (Reduce fiat to crypto friction, but checking today, even minerva, who has done a sale on gnosis auction/xdai managed not to make a wallet version for this)\n \n* Bodgan of Stater -> learning there: Many projects already have a free tradable token and make their first public sales later. (Also Minerva)\n\n\n## Find an agreement with gnosis about responsibilities in the future (we agree to not agree)  \n\n\n* Gnosis forum entry: https://forum.gnosis.io/t/dxdao-x-gnosisdao-partnership-discussion/905\n* Proposal draft (shared with gnosis): https://hackmd.io/hAtiuLS4RAe40jBqf6dY8Q\n* Variation of possible solutions (My note): https://hackmd.io/2Tv1OzGMRtChwa5VDmbd4w\n\n(No feedback from gnosis, talks later also not lead to any deal)\n\n## Start adaption for Mesa IDO frontend\n\n* Geromimo made a minimal draft and this helped us big to kick off things. Adam implemented a first version of this.\n\n\n## Start of standardization of Service for IDO Projects\n\nThis also helped me to think about who are our costumers:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=671031870\n\nGenerally speaking, my first month set the stage, and we are still executing this.\n\n\n### Other things I worked on\n\n* Analyze different token sale mechanics: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=485683229\n\n\n\n## Long Term/More\n\nFrom my first proposal: https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-martin-krung-24-11-24-12/2363\n\n###  Establish agile project management for Mesa IDO\n\nWe have been doing this, Venky helped me. We have a daily call, which is time-boxed to 15 min, and we have a weekly show and tell call on Monday. We are not doing pure agile, the team is not mature enough.\n\n###  Start a weekly 1h mesa IDO call \n\nI do this every Wednesday. Mostly I do some research what's happening on the market with other IDO project or ongoing sales, we discuss strategy and do some refinement.\n\nSheet with all the calls I made:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvKrG1NnRozN9MtEi-Kq7Dh6mBzWqcLMnWdmb38Q6c0/edit#gid=795583827\n\n\n### Take over Mesa deployment from LevelK\n\nNothing to do, old Mesa is defunct now.\n\n### Enhance Documentation for Mesa IDO\n\nWe started a gitbook lately: https://mesa-1.gitbook.io/mesa/\n\nIn general, I did write some things, but after very limited feedback I decide that writing down things does not move the project forward.\n\n### Spread the word about DXdao over my personal twitter account\n\nI do, from time to time, also use it as the main tool for recruiting new members.\n\n### Helping research/develop new products\n\nWe have to finish the 3 products we got, no need for this and if, not my focus right now.\n\n### Help to develop a vision for DXdao\n\nNo time for this, even I think it's still needed.\n\n### Help with decentralized infrastructure research/testing\n\nNo time for this, we use the graph and may be radical but don't run hardware. I guess I mostly wrote this because I have some DevOps skills, running web server for 20y.\n\n### Start to learn smart contract development\n\nI did implement some features (in March) and I have a working environment for this now. I understand even better how smart contract work and what the limits are. I started working as a dev to support the team, to understand pain points and to do some research on a next-generation sale mechanism.\n\nhttps://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts/commits/feature/distributeAllTokens-for-FairSale\nhttps://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts/commits/feature/pointdutch-with-off-chain-sp\n\nOther work in December:\n\nSetup of https://snapshot.page/ for DXdao: https://hackmd.io/Wvj_SUfaRMC8p2D9uo2RHA\n\n\n\n# Further work\n\n\nAs I did not do a proposal after my first one, I started to work with giving every month a focus/topic. This is not how this should work, but my commitment and responsibility stayed the same.\n\nOn the tech side best is to visit my github profile: \n\nhttps://github.com/martinkrung\n \n \n# January 2021 / recruiting\n\n## Facts\n\n- Adam started in the second week of February \n- Recruiting calls with ~10 person\n- Help them to onboard and make trial proposal\n- Bertie as a Designer has been found, and first payment proposal passed for him. (Bertie was introduced by Nico)\n- Start with the Wednesday weekly mesa call, where we talk about the product and strategy. At the start normally Sky/Nico/Adam and me are in the call.\n- We do not reach a deal with Gnosis\n\n- Presentation about Mesa in the community call https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12HuuvWvzAe6HVIDL3RQs_-Td7_JmuxIlrCLjnIJvy5o/edit#slide=id.g7980198e86_0_21\n\n## Overview\n\nHeavy focus on recruiting. Getting a team together. \n\nI had the strategy to hire anyone you wanted to join because I could not wait to get the right people to join.  I recruited on twitter and this worked quite well (Adam/Hamza). (Later Ben/Nathan)\n \nI recruited 2 people, Adam and Hamza for Mesa directly,  Some team members have been pointed to me from outside Lee/Ruy. I had at least 10 calls.\n\nI recruited Adam/Hamza/Ben (I had other candidates, but they dropped out before contributing). I did a lot of babysitting to some.\n\n\n\n\n## Learning\n\n\n- Some form of trust has to be there, new workers have to come in from a angel which makes sens.\n-  People not communication well make no sens in such a setup (Start-up/ Full-Remote and Async)\n- People can learn technical skills if there is a good team interaction quite fast, but character stuff normally doesn't change\n- It makes no sens to have workers which are not interested in the dxDao and what we try to achieve, for this dxDao is just another employer and for them, a normal job is a less risky option.\n- Drop outs can be positive, since Lee left communication is much better\n- Team building takes time, during build-up workers not communicate well can have a high impact (even if he is productive)\n- It's hard to ramp up from zero because people need first to understand what you are trying to build\n- Our recruiting is focused that anons can join, but at the end we have no anons, for all non anons this is strange. We should have a filter for this. Anon: trial 2 weeks as now,  Non-anon: That's your job, start now.\n\n- Not having a working product makes it difficult to onboard because at the start there are no clear tasks to cut out.\n\n## Data/Documents\n\nI made my guide for onboarding: https://hackmd.io/Ak969SQvQU6ulyULfMv_zg\n\nTook part in the Gov2 discussion: https://hackmd.io/FskYlDJkR2GjqMh4wO5fEw\n\n# February 2021: team building, design\n\n## Facts\n\n- Hamza & Ryu joined at the start February\n- Lee joined 8 February\n- Bertie started with the design on February\n- Nico starts working on the smart contracts\n- Lee worked mostly on the single sale pages\n- Hamza worked on the overview page\n- Adam started working on the subgraph\n- Github repo set up with continuous integration\n- Gitub Project as project management\n\n\n## Overview\n\nMostly focus on team building and get the team to understand what we are going to build. Work with Bertie for the Design. Bertie understands the product and was able to creates a nice UX. The Team get to know each other and understands what we are building.\n\n\n## Learning\n\n- In scrum the dev team is responsible to pick a task, define sprint goal and deliver on the sprint end. This only works in an established team where the team feels they are responsible to deliver. Lee, with his little communication, somehow was a blocker to get the team into this mindset. \n \n- Lack of communication from one member can lead to work everyone in silos.\n- For sprints to work, you should make estimates on task, with a new technology and not so well experience devs this is not possible in a serious way\n\n- Bertie could not develop a profound understanding of the auction sales mechanism and not work on charting data on its own. But he had other ideas, which would be suitable for dashboard.\n\n## Data/Documents\n\nShort intro for Scrum Kick-off: https://hackmd.io/avom5FttRfmB3uCER7xP7A\n\n\n# March 2021: Scrum/Research\n\n## Facts:\n\n- Design is finished by Bertie\n- Moved project to trello in the middle of march\n- Start having time boxed daily meetings\n- Venky supports us in your read to agile\n\n## Overview\n\nChange work structure to scrum and start having weekly sprints.  (Venky helped us) \n\nI started to code smart contract to implement some features which, I think, will be important. Research about of chain computation of the settlement price of Fairsale. (Which is possible and maybe would make setting bids cheaper) \n\nI found another, slightly different sale mechanics I call Point-Dutch, which is less capital efficient, simpler and may be more fair in its outcome.\n\nI did focus on research because I was thinking the team was working fine and MVP was quite near. \n\n\n## Learning\n\n- Daily Meeting have been focused and timebox\n- Weekly meeting with show and tell, work with Trello (kanban) and some form of loose weekly goal.\n- At some point the lacking maturity of the team shoes by having merge conflicts. We try to set a standard to work better with git to tackle this.\n- Research has been a success and got me deeper into understanding what we are building, but focus has to be back on a minimal MVP.\n\n\n\n## Data/Documents\n\n- Research if Fairsale would be able to use off chain settlement:  https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-point-dutch-resolver-py\n\n- Smart contract hacking: https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts/commits?author=martinkrung\n\n- Presentation about DXdao in German: https://hackmd.io/s0Pw3FXPQimzI-dDE6WxjA, for https://www.ffhs.ch/en/degree-programmes/continuing-education/cas-blockchain\n\n- Research about Point-Dutch Auction: https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-point-dutch-resolver-py\n\n\n- The way to optimistic roadmap for Q2+: https://hackmd.io/quKURjhZS4OLtRLMiHC9vw\n- Testing gas usage for distributeAllTokens() function in fixed price sale: https://hackmd.io/FRvE-hMjSg-1fSyaWjYEnw\n\n- Analyze Oplis for DXventures: https://hackmd.io/ly1mwXjaTqajkXNeww4jBg\n\n\n# April 2021: Bring the parts together\n\n\n## Facts:\n\n- Lees commitment shrinks considerable, until his fraudulent proposal. I kicked lee out on 16. April.\n- Nico finished core work on smart contract\n- Adam finishes core work on the subgraph\n\n\n## Overview\n\nIt's clear that we could not deliver the MVP as planned. Bring the component together is much harder than we thought.\n\nWork to help to develop the Front-End too, I did add a static page. In a way the team is not as mature as I thought.  We have some pain right now to glue the different components together. They are mostly done, but integrating is more complex than we taught.  I try to make the team to coordinate/communicate better by join the daily work.\n\nI remove lee from the team: After he requests to be paid, in full, I ask him to reduce the request, which he did by himself. (4 weeks -> 3 weeks)\n\nBut even after he committed the proposal he did not pick up work again but showed up in the daily. After this, I did look into what he has worked, and I did clearly see that his performance dropped. \n\nLosing lee this way was a major blow for us.\n\n\n## Data/Documents\n\nMy work on the interface: https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface/commits?author=martinkrung\n\nData Types from Smart contract to Front-End: https://hackmd.io/h_RYYe1DR6i1qGhpPcKwNg\n\nLees hours: https://hackmd.io/3RBsVYpaRdyaCezU0SMFoA\n\n\n# May 2021: MVP, MVP\n\n## Facts\n\n- Lee never requested payment for his work in April.\n- Adam tells us that he migrates to Vienna and will stop working for us at the end of the month. (His wish to migrate has been know since the start. He would like to stay, but migration to Europe is only possible eth an official day job).\n- Adam finishes work on the subgraph\n- Nico agreed to work on code clean-up, but take mostly a break in May.\n- Nethan joins the team as Bizdev support\n\n## Overview\n\nWe worked hard to glue all the parts together. The complexity  of the smart contract with factories takes his toll. Team spirit improved, Losing lee had some good side effect that there is much more communication in the team.\n\nWith a shrinking team, I try get a company in to help us. Talk to ethworks and spaceinch.\n\nAt the end of the month we are able to make a purchase on the fix price sale on xdai with a working interface. A new sale can be deployed in  5 min over command line. \n\n\n## Data/Documents\n\nWork which could be done by a external company: https://hackmd.io/AQJdeF7EQhq-eoFQaoEI5g\n\nFeedback on Design from Encasa: https://hackmd.io/hHwezVtBTtCPBRuvepYGXw\n\n\n# Core Learnings over the last months\n\n- The Graph vs other solutions. We just used the standard software for this, but somehow to complex structure of the smart contract made the sub-graph quite complex.\n- I would more try to build everything in parallel and having things connected early, then in single repo.\n- Tech first, less design.\n- Only take selected candidates in the team, communication is key and bad communicators can have big influence.\n- Team building takes time.\n- Do more micromanagement and be more demanding.\n- Less time to try to scrummify processes, just go straight to kanban\n- Overengineering has to be reduced\n- I would not commit any date this early because I committed to finish the MVP at the end of March, even before I had a team.\n\n# Reality of building a product:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zeSRmfH.png)\n\n# Compensation\n\nMy compensation,in accordance with the worker guidelines. I will make proposal on xdai for this for every month. Payee is Conative, my company, which I own under my private name. I will make 3 alchemy proposals for 3 * 2 month payment. On alchemy proposal per week, each over the next 3 weeks.\n\n## First month 24/11 - 24/12\n\nExperience Level: 5\n\nFull-time, first month,  24/11/2020 - 24/12/2020\n\n$6,400 xDai (80% of $8,000)\n$4,800 DXD (80% of $6,000)\n0.1334% REP (80% of 0.1667%)\n\n\n\nSummary of compensation:\n\n- $6,400 xDai\n- Approval for 4,800 USD to be paid as 9.18 DXD in a vesting contract continuously for two years with a one-year cliff when the work agreement finishes.

It has been a great experience so far, and the Aqua team has provided positive feedback. This has been my first work experience at a DAO and in the crypto domain, and it’s been nothing short of amazing.\n\nDue to current work obligations at my full-time role, I will be continuing part-time for the current proposal period. In the future, I’ll be gradually increasing my time availability, with the goal of going full-time.\n\nIn the trial period, I was quite focused on the front-end development efforts of Aqua. This included work on the fixed-price sale user interface, IPFS integration, user feedback collection tools, as well as UX improvements around communicating sale mechanics.\n\nFor the trial period, I wasn’t very engaged with the smart contract development of Aqua. Over the next weeks, I hope to work more on smart contracts, as gaining experience in smart contract development was one of my key goals in joining DXdao. I will also continue to work on the front-end and overall user experience improvements.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I’ll also improve my engagement with the DAO governance. I tend to usually be a bit silent and observe before I start engaging with communities.
