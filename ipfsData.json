In addition, as outlined [here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxlisbon-contributor-stipend-and-funds/3367), I'm also asking for 300 xDai as a reimboursement for the flights to Lisbon to join the ETHLisbon hackathon.\n\n## Proof of work\n\nI’ve mainly focused on Carrot this past month, covering all development tasks. On the side I've also performed some developments on the Swapr frontend, namely:\n\n- Added SWPR on xDai to the SDK and to the Swapr default token list.\n- Prepared the beta 6 and 6.1 releases.\n- Fixed an issue for which not all pairs were shown on the frontend in case many are created (the issue manifested itself on xDai first where pairs with a considerable amount of liquidity were not shown in the \"all pairs\" page).\n- Fixed an issue that caused reward amounts/tokens to be mismatched in a farming campaign page when the farming campaign had 2 or more reward tokens. The issue first manifested itself with the ARBI/SWPR campaign on Arbitrum. An update to the subgraph was necessary and the frontend was subsequently updated to adapt to the subgraph GraphQL API schema change.\n- Renamed APY to APR across the frontend (no compounding due to LP fees currently taken into account in the farmign campaigns returns calculation).\n- Prepared the beta 6.2 release.\n\nThe proof about the claims above can be verified by having a look at [my commits on the Swapr frontend](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/commits/develop?author=luzzif) and [Swapr SDK](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-sdk/commits/develop?author=luzzif).\n\nI've also made an update to the lambda function Coingecko currently uses to fetch various Swapr-related data (most importantly, currently active farming campaigns across chains), adding an endpoint to fetch SWPR's circulating supply. The endpoint is currently used by Coingecko to display that info in the SWPR token page. Have a look at the proof of work by clicking [here](https://github.com/luzzif/swapr-coingecko/commits/master?author=luzzif).\n\nOn the farming smart contracts, I've added a standalone campaign smart contract, which can be used to create staking-based reward campaigns even without deploying a factory. Proof [here](https://github.com/luzzif/erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts/commits/master).\n\nMost of the work though, has been performed on Carrot, for which as of now I don't have proof, since the code is still private until the release comes (hopefully soon). Nice progress has been made in the frontend, with a flexible framework to display custom charts for various metric types and massive improvements to the UI and responsiveness. Once the code is made public in the future, proof for these claims will be available to everyone since pretty much all the commits on the platform are mine, so keep an eye out for that.","title":"DAI payout (26/09/2021-26/10/2021) - luzzifoss","hash":"QmaUVViW5EB7xwYyBZNq1Q9VcxfNjTWxogJYFJc8bPQAVy"},"0x00ab138b59eb3ba06c51494920ce00c6d6f296743f6ec5a53bbe1ba0dc18e10e":{"description":"## Timeframe:\n\n31/07/2022-31/09/2022, 2 months\n\nI wanna preface this proposal by apologizing for being late and it was because of Nimi proposal that wasn’t yet resolved and I didn’t have clear idea what to write.\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nSwapr (60%):\n\n* Curve Factory Pools implementation on the SDK\n* Making sure we follow up with the front-end refactoring plan and storybook usage\n* DIY Farming Top up Campaigns\n* Bugs and improvements\n* Eco router Improvements and new Dexes\n\nNimi(40%):\n\n* Making sure we have top notch front-end along with writing bunch of features which we are doing all the time!\n\n* Onboarding of new devs\n\n## Proof of work:\n\n* In the previous period the big focus was refactoring I spent alot of time researching best react design patters and practices. I lead couple of discussions related to it here is the google docs with the summary https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mr9gleqXWNDVrJ27hEKaBC29etMUNVjYRQdyeffEyH8\n* Storybook: implemented storybook and also had a sync call with DxGov squad to make sure its similar structure heres the pr https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pull/1129 and also I setup Chromatic automatic deployment which we are planning to integrate with Figma for smoother development flow\n* Farming section improvements such as [Farming Simulation](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pull/1001) and [DIY farming reward improvements](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pull/1079)\n\n## Self evaluation previous working period:\n\nWhat I didn’t do well:\n\n* Sometimes I get so focused on tasks Im on that Im not that active on the chats and following whats happening. I wish to improve on that.\n* Drama that was happening brought me lot of stress and definitely impacted my productivity. I guess I should learn to not get so riled up by that and just focus on work.\n\nWhat I did well:\n\n* Research related to front-end restructuring really helped me alot on improving my knowledge of react. I think some time dedicated to just learning instead of implementing can go a long way! Also discussion with other developers are really good way to improve. What I really liked were are few discussion with Diogo, Velu and Berteotti related to front-end refactoring where we all prepared beforehand which can set a precedent on how this can be done in the future.\n\n## Compensation\n\nI will be applying as level 5 full-time for two months.

The bonding curve [was later shut down](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x97c7d7e5ed9f74f62ef5d15a6dffac8a62a4d52b883491a7e8b13cf7816991ad), and the[ DXD Buyback Program](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8)<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"> </span>was passed in May 2021 to acquire DXD on the open market in a trustless manner. The original proposal authorized $1m in DXD purchases; the program was clarified and expanded to the buyback reserve and has been extended an additional seven times (each extension authorizing $1m in new purchases). \n\nIn the year since the program launched, [13,391.41 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing) have been purchased on mainnet and Gnosis Chain for an[ average price of 0.178 ETH/DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing). Using the USD price at the time of purchase, $7.5m of DXD has been purchased.\n\nIn addition to the DXD minted from the bonding curve, there has also been DXD issuance from DXdao’s original 100k DXD pre-mint. So far, 475 DXD has been issued on-chain to contributors in vested contracts or marketing expenses. An additional 458 DXD was issued to LPs to Swapr LPs for farming last summer, and DXdao has committed to an additional ~2,600 DXD (estimated) to contributors that has not been issued to vesting contracts.\n\nSo in total, starting from the original circulating supply of 48,976 DXD, subtracting the 13,391 DXD purchased through the buyback program and adding the 3,533 that’s been issued from the DXdao pre-mint, **results in a current circulating supply of ~39,118 DXD**, although more than 1,500 DXD is vesting for another 2+ years. The current DXD price on Swapr is $683, so the current market capitalization of DXD is $26.3m, still comfortably below the ~$45m in the [DXdao general treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) and [the buyback reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521).\n\nAfter the initial proposal, DXdao governance [shifted towards a new token model](https://daotalk.org/t/proposed-dxd-token-model/2898), where ETH from the bonding curve buyback reserve would be used to purchase DXD. Since the buyback reserve is actually in the DXD token contract, ETH from the general treasury has been used until the token contract is updated.\n\n\n### **Adjustments and clarifications**\n\nOver the past few months, the community has been trying to reach consensus on issues regarding the Buyback Program, namely 1. The accounting breakdown between DXD in General Treasury vs. DXD buyback reserve 2. Clarification on what counts as NAV 3. Continued support for DXD buyback after the DXD Buyback Reserve is depleted \n\nRegarding these issues, this proposal approves the following:\n\n\n\n1. The DXD purchased through [the first buyback proposal](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) (3,659), which did not mention the buyback reserve, can remain in the general treasury where it could be used for liquidity provisioning or other use cases deemed appropriate by DXdao governance. The rest of the DXD purchased through subsequent buyback extensions (9,732.41), as well as any future DXD that’s purchased using funds from the buyback reserve, should be burned. In terms of ETH spent, 481 ETH was used from the general treasury and 1,897 ETH from the buyback reserve (currently). \n2. The Buyback Program has previously defined DXdao’s NAV (or net asset value) as the US dollar amount of ETH and stablecoins in its treasury. This should be clarified to also include any Swapr deposits, staked ETH or any stablecoin deposits on Ethereum mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Arbitrum One and any other sanctioned DXdao base. \n3. If and when the DXD Buyback Program depletes the buyback reserve, funds from the DXdao treasury can be used to purchase DXD on the open market at up to 70% of NAV, so long as this calculation accounts for runway and future funding for product development.\n\n**The Future of DXD:** DXdao governance commits to devote further resources and a dedicated DXD Token Working Group to address long-term questions about DXD value accrual and other questions around NAV calculation, DXdao supplied-liquidity, integration into Governance 2.0 as well as runway for product development. \n\n\n### **Extension Details**\n\nGiven the additional funds left in the Buyback Reserve, this proposal authorizes an additional $1m in DXD purchases under the same conditions as [the previous extension](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xd2114f86cd669d2a34b529e822024d4b280f7427639f0399106c4ae81997a2d8) so long as the circulating market cap of DXD is less than the NAV calculation of its treasury, as further clarified above.\n\nThis proposal sends 373 ETH to the ETHrelayer contract for the multichain multisig, identified as, `0x3e99bEd13071176fE06b317b33e2dcd1E1c9f2BE` , which will relay the ETH to the Multichain multisig address, previously identified as `0x9467dcFD4519287e3878C018c02f5670465a9003` whose signatories have been verified as REP holders, which will convert it to WETH and bridge it over to be deposited into the[ GPv1 relayer on Gnosis Chain](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions), `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`.\n\n\n### **Risks and considerations**\n\nThe DXD buyback program continues to take place on Gnosis Chain, a sidechain with less security properties than Ethereum. The Buyback Program has been running for almost a year with few problems; the GP Relayer has worked to complete the purchases at the market price. There is a concern that Gnosis Protocol v1 on Gnosis Chain will have limited support, but DXdao community members are striving to maintain the network of solvers. The community is also exploring additional options\n\nDXdao has already spent over $7.5m repurchasing DXD. This has increased the price of DXD relative to ETH but it still falls below the book value of ETH in the treasury.\n\nFull execution of this proposal relies on the Multichain multi-sig, which has already bridged and transferred millions of dollars of assets to Gnosis Chain.\n\nAdditional questions on DXD token value accrual after the buyback reserve is depleted, the relationship between the treasury and DXdao operations and product development, as well as integrations with Governance 2.0 still need to be addressed by DXdao governance in the future.\n","title":"DXD Buyback Program Adjustments, Extension #8 and Transfer of 373 ETH [Mirror Proposal]","hash":"QmfEbQWW3zfzRKCfbxJ3cHezuBLyv37FkFq9StcKfVncyh"},"0x02f9259985b7bb83419ffcb539eb169bb3d802bcfb92a5f4a59c424d47318204":{"description":" I, Cantillon#9803, am requesting REP in relation to my DXdao Discord participation level.

The items that was not completed during Q1 was moved forward to Q2.\n\n![Swapr Roadmap - Q2 2022|690x388](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/daostack/optimized/2X/c/cf6ae709cb14c93b3ea811ebc49d9476dae7747c_2_690x388.jpeg)\n\nThe redesign of Swapr to fit well with the new brand has been started.\nWe are starting with these pages:\n\n* Liquidity Pages\n* DIY farming\n* Swapbox\n\nNext period we will start with:\n\n* Rewards\n* Modals\n* Bridge\n* Stats\n\nWe are currently testing the integrations of Socket V2, Curve, CowSwap. These are planned to be released for the upcoming Beta V12-13 releases. \n\n![cowswap-comingsoon|500x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/daostack/optimized/2X/6/612c68e25ef0f4ec6483b22e5b884fac2d4f05a9_2_500x500.png)\n\nWe should have not put so many big things into the V12 release now looking back. This has stopped us from releasing a new version for Swapr. \n\nWe have started our journey where Swapr Supports more networks than the smart contracts are deployed on. Swapr Ecorouter and bridge will be available on Polygon. This requires some UI/UX changes where we disable elements which requires Swapr Smart contracts. \n\n\n### Carrot\nFor carrot I helped out on the first IRL Carrot Campaign where we delivered carrots through QR codes printed on Flyers. I helped coordinate these efforts with Nathan @sky @KeenanL @int_blue @adamazad . The design of the flyer & the [landing page](https://carrot.eth.limo/amsterdam) was created by Entrecasa. \n\n![93a05048b|136x240](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/daostack/original/2X/a/acb1fc4ff8a80e43acf6a875185d8f1a8edb6b37.gif)\n![image 3|496x499](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/daostack/optimized/2X/c/c1e561d89cd19d36bf425a8a9a10d3ca0641f505_2_496x499.jpeg)\n\n### ETH Amsterdam\nHelped out on the activation campaign for the GGG Daoist Event. DXdao chose to have a nailbar. I simply created the graphic that was put on the decals.\nI also researched and created mockups for swag that was never ordered in time for ETH amsterdam. All this work will be reused for future Conferences. We did order tshirts that never delivered to the conference due to some issues with holidays + bad luck. UPS should send back the swag to the swag company and they will contact us for future delivery destination we want it to be sent to.\n\nDuring the ETH Amsterdam Conference there was a hackathon where me, @JohnKelleher @adamazad @Violet @dlabs hacked on an one click ENS profile page deployer Called [Nimi](https://twitter.com/0xNimi) \n![image|690x466](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/daostack/optimized/2X/3/34048b20e300b139a7afdf017c3878a553e77509_2_690x466.jpeg)\n![image|690x414](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/daostack/optimized/2X/1/1cdbf19ab6655830e7aa4c0d97bf21ebbad02ee1_2_690x414.jpeg)\n\nThe hackathon went well and we \"won\" together with 13 other teams( out of 165 teams ).\nYou can see the pitch here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9L-0ZZvZDg&t=928s\n\n\n### Copenhagen\nWe had a short visit at the Copenhagen flames where we talked Esports to Web3 strategies with the founders.

Full-time with 40 workable days/2 months\n\n**Position:** DXvoice coordinator, Community Leader, Internal Operations and Documentation\n\n**Background:** Hey everyone! This slightly late proposal comes off the tail end of Lisbon Blockchain week. Meeting fascinating new people left and right was a very unique and humbling experience that I’ll never forget. Also; having the opportunity to meet DXdao contributors and develop more personal relationships has ignited a deeper passion, and I'm more confident than ever that we'll be able to achieve and shatter our goals. wagmi folks! *(Liscon abbreviation of the week).*\n\nDecember will also be my one year DXdao anniversary! (DXdaonniversary?) Perhaps the time to share words will be then, but I'd like to thank each and every contributor, community member, and otherwise for coming along with me for this journey. DXdao welcomed me as one of its own, and we have grown so much together. Thank you. *(I expect cake, you know. hahaha)*\n\n## Reflection on previous proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [Sept - November ](https://daotalk.org/t/keenan-luke-contributor-proposal-for-09-2021-to-11-2021/3343), what I think I did well includes:\n\n - **SWPR Emissions** - Despite a few hiccups, I believe those of us involved with SWPR emissions have done a great job at communicating, monitoring and smoothly passing relevant proposals. Since the first few frothy Epochs, the Swapr protocol has been steadily growing and integrating more projects.\n- **Discord REP Boosts** - I believe that the Discord REP Boosts have been successfully accomplishing the goal of further decentralizing governance AND involving the community with said governance. Q3 Boosts have passed and proposals have begun to pass.\n- **Community Calls** - Although I am unhappy with other facets of the community (noted below), I once again find myself thrilled over the continued growth of the DXdao community calls. They quickly became our most populated call earlier in Q3, and today stand strong with much more consistent engagement and 30-50 attendee count.\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **Community** - Although the community (Discord specifically) has been growing at a healthy pace in both member count and activity, the ratio of active participation is lower than I would like. (Percentage of accounts lurking vs interacting). Additionally, growth has diminished over the previous period (Adversely reflected by moderation/removal of dead acc./spam attack mitigation). I'd like to devote more time to retention and activity ratio as metrics, which should open the door to more natural growth.\n![image|690x325](upload://kMMLYmQxcOCQu6SRhqRAe1Pd5Xd.png)\n- **DXdocs** - No room for excuses. DXdocs was well received and is used by many of our squads (with most others looking to migrate onto it). I had a lot on my plate, but I should have prioritized DXdocs content updates and releases better. Coming into the next working period, it has become one of my top priorities.\n\n## Goals/Responsibilities:\n\n**[65%] DXvoice Coordination and Execution**\n\n* Lead DXdao’s “DXvoice” squad\n  * Organize, run, and manage various initiatives including but not limited to squad calls, marketing processes, community calls, events, content coordination, etc…\n  * Explore the potential for DXvoice to become a more independent entity with its own goals.

Although these community costs are still small, I would like to transition these to either their own proposal or the multi-sig as the costs grow - bonus benefit of deeper accountability and a trail that can be followed if I were to disappear.\n\nThe first proposal will request Month one’s xDai at the beginning of the period.

DXdao participated in GGG as a sponsor and conducted multiple talks and workshops throughout the week-long conference. It was a positive experience for so many DXdao contributors to attend the conference. During GGG I co-led a Contributor Experience focused workshop at the DAOist on “Building Healthier Teams.” This workshop allowed me the opportunity to discuss the challenges contributors face within a DAO, as well as highlight the amazing work DXdao is doing in the people operations area of our DAO. A detailed article on the workshop can be found here:The Daoist GGG - “Open Office Hours” — The DAOist\n\n**What was okay:**\n \nIn the past 2 months, I supported the onboarding of 2 new developers, @jorgelopes @velusgautam and QA engineer @Philipp16. I believe I did okay at integrating these new contributors with the current contributors at DXdao. As we grow, my goal is to ensure new contributors are not only onboarding by familiarizing themselves with DXdao operations, but through consistent collaboration with contributors in the DXdao community as well. Virtual retreats and happy hours have been proposed as potential opportunities to facilitate new and existing contributor unification.\n\n**What needs improvement:**\n\nDuring this proposal period we began the search for a DAO Counsel. @powers, @fluiddrop, and I conducted multiple calls with contributor applicants. However, due to the complexity of the role we were unable to successfully source a new contributor to take over this position. Since then we have found multiple candidates who can potentially fill this role, and plan to onboard them during this upcoming period.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\nThis proposal falls under the new compensation structure enacted on 01/01/2022.\n\nLevel 6 \nTime commitment- 100% \nContributing to DXdao since 3/22/2021.

I have been working in Swapr adding functionalities and additional chains.\nWhen I started working at DXdao, although I had development experience, I had no web development experience. This impacts my ability to fully contribute to the level the DAO deems necessary. I made a huge effort to learn and have been doing so from the start. I believe my performance has been improving but understandably it is not yet at a desired level. I believe that it was possible, with time, to get it to level or even find a niche where I could contribute more but at this point it is not possible.\nI believe this happened in part due to a different expectations, specifically stated above, between the DAO and myself.

Conferences help to promote professional contributor growth, provide an opportunity for product exposure, and allow for networking. Thus, we provide an individual stipend to DXdao contributors who are interested in participating in them. Contributor event stipends will be allocated based on the following criteria:\n\n- % of time contributing to DXdao\n  - All contributors are eligible for a stipend. The % commitment to DXdao determines the stipend amount\n  - For example, 80% contribution time - $3,200 annually ($1,600 /6 mos)\n- All conference stipends must be reviewed and approved ahead of time by the ContributorX\n- The event stipend distribution will be handled individually by guilds\n- In addition, if a contributor represents DXdao and hosts a talk, panel discussion, or workshop, they are eligible for an additional stipend beyond their annual event stipend. This additional stipend will require prior approval and be claimed through the Services guild. \n\n**$30k - DXdao offsite**\n\nIn line with the DXevents proposal that passed last year, we propose to continue our annual DXretreat in 2023 and request 30k for funding this offsite, (both previous off-site allocations were for 30k.) The ContributorX will be responsible for the coordination and execution of 2023 offsite. If a remaining budget is available, it has also been discussed to explore the idea of having a technical retreat in 2023. See here for further information on the 2021 DXretreat and 2022 DXretreat.\n\n**$20k - Conference or event sponsorships**\n\nWe are proposing to allocate 20k towards potential DXdao conference or event sponsorships.

This was posted on [DAOtalk on August 3](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-aug-sept-2022/4429?u=powers).\n\n\nMy family finally secured childcare! So, I will be returning to my previous 90% commitment for August and September, but now on central time.\n\nCaney Fork’s priorities are the same as last proposal ([ENS](https://daotalk.org/t/delegate-dxdaos-ens-tokens-to-caneyfork-eth/4387), [DXD Token WG](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-token-working-group/4388/11) and [Budget](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-budget-2h2022/4394)). While there was significant progress on each of these, more work needs to be done to gain consensus and move things forward. Also to note, in line with my reflection on my last worker proposal and these goals, Caney Fork’s % devoted to governance will increase to 60% from 50%.\n\nGovernance 60%:\n\n\n\n* Work with Decentral Labs to organize weekly governance calls, organized under # Governance tag.\n* Facilitate DXD Buyback Program execution along with dLabs. Post tri-weekly DXD volume updates\n* Integrate DXdao into ENS governance. Develop platform and signaling process for important votes, and investigate the technical details of delegation through governance\n* Drive conversation forward on DXD Token Working Group, lead first couple meetings and report back to forum\n* Find consensus on a budget. Re-do 2H2022 Budget and incorporate feedback from community on burn and resource allocation.\n* Goals and Deliverables: Caney Fork ENS Platform post by Aug 10; Expenses update post by August 15, DXD Token WG proposal and kickoff on Aug 25. Four month budget approved on-chain by August 31. DXdao in ENS DAO post in ENS forum by September 20. DXD Token WG check-in on Sept 25.\n\nContributorX (20%)\n\n* Work with Melanie and Allyq on upgrading worker proposal process\n* Meet with [DXLegal assessment](https://daotalk.org/t/dxlegal-assessments/4304) participants, answer questions and facilitate public presentations from the three candidates.\n* Goals: Wrap up DXlegal assessments by Sept. 15; Proposal update to contributor guidelines by Sept 20\n\nDXvoice (20%)\n\n* Write July and August month in review along with Keenan and Wayne\n* Operation Decentralization!\n\n\n\nLogistics and Compensation \n\n* Work period: August 1, 2022 - September 30, 2022 this will be at 90% worker commitment as I write the [Dose of DeFi newsletter](https://doseofdefi.substack.com/). \n* Contributor Level: 8 as outlined in the [DXdao Pay Structure Update - December 2021](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xaa3c6d9953d5510a0f014f946e94f03f07a4e5259718e86f07d41d255917e410)\n* August compensation \n    * $8,100 in USDC/Dai \n    * $8,550 in DXD, using 30 day average for DXD price or minimum $523, vested for 3 years with one year cliff \n    * No REP (I think?) as Caney Fork previously reached 4% max on mainnet, but is now at 3.5%.

My calculations on my old sheet for 2020/2021 DXD ended up being incorrect for a lot of contributors, and I didn’t see my mistakes until this past month when contributors began their vesting proposals. These are mistakes I should have caught sooner, way before a proposal was passed on chain approving the incorrect numbers! The mistakes were most likely calculation errors as I was doing things manually – this has led me to start re-thinking my process for collecting and calculating data for contributors. Clearly doing things manually can lead to mistakes – going forward I am going to spend more time learning how to automate processes as well as learn how to use excel/google sheets in a more accurate manner. On a better note, the Contributor Review went splendidly this go around, and I have a feeling it will just keep getting better!

Since then, 6,313 DXD have been purchased on mainnet and xDai for an [average price of 0.152 ETH/DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit?usp=sharing). Using the USD price at the time of purchase, $2.7m of DXD has been purchased. This is just over 10% of the DXD circulating supply. \n\nThe [buyback program was updated](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153) in June to increase the slippage tolerance of trades as well as clarify the accounting measures. The[ buyback program was then extended](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x6f4bb1bb12469639b4af6f67ee04b174b07df211b3de45e6254de65082446af0) for another $1m in August and [then another $1m in September](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d). The total amount of DXD purchased is quickly approaching the limit placed on it by the previous proposal and soft community consensus has demonstrated support for another $1m extension.\n\nAccounting for the 6,313 DXD purchased and the 920 DXD that has been issued to contributors in vested contracts (461.4) and to LPs for Swapr farming rewards (458.6), the outstanding DXD supply (43,583) represents a market cap of [$30m](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dxdao#markets) - still comfortably below the [$64.5m in ETH and stables in the DXdao treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) and [the $10m in the buyback reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521). The buyback program is intended to address this discrepancy and acquire an undervalued asset.\n\nThe [proposed DXD token model ](https://daotalk.org/t/proposed-dxd-token-model/2898)that has been embraced by the community intends to upgrade the DXD bonding curve and shift to a different buyback method for DXD. While the community moves toward a new model, the methods outlined in the DXD Buyback Program and purchases through the [GP Relayer](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmd8TCEr6syKxAnmuBH3hsyvxfSgRJgANLTTorp3JGZY77) on xDai and Mainnet enable DXdao to drive value to DXD holders now. There has [also been discussion](https://daotalk.org/t/expand-dxd-buyback-purchase-options/3380) in the community about shifting the buyback program to Aqua or another relayer that could interact directly with Swapr.\n\n**Details**\n\nThis proposal extends the DXD Buyback Program for another $1m to $4m total under the same conditions outlined in the original [Buyback Program signal proposal](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8), [the parameter update](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153) and the [first extension](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x6f4bb1bb12469639b4af6f67ee04b174b07df211b3de45e6254de65082446af0) and [second extension](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d).\n\nThese and other DXD purchases through the Buyback Program have contributed to the community’s intention to use the buyback reserve to purchase DXD. ETH from [DXdao’s general treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) can be used in lieu of the buyback reserve until the DXD token contract is upgraded and that ETH is recovered. In total, the [buyback reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521) has 2,499 ETH and so far, 958 ETH has been used to purchase 6,313 DXD through the buyback program.\n\n**Risks and considerations**\n\nThe program will take place on xDai, a sidechain with less security properties than Ethereum. The Buyback Program has been running for four months with few problems; the GP Relayer has worked to complete the purchases at the market price. There is a concern that Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai will have limited support, but DXdao community members are striving to maintain the network of solvers. The community is also exploring additional options. \n\nDXdao has already spent almost $2.6m repurchasing DXD. This has increased the price of DXD relative to ETH but it still falls below the book value of ETH in the treasury.","title":"DXD Buyback Program Extension #3","hash":"QmRmTUCZq8TN7pko2QYswDWEg2mHAuyjy5zeRBsNsiVSzC"},"0x16e7b21013503f6234fd7a0f5979ad03d8e5116c7615c2da9c6ffd696287d85b":{"description":"\n    \nThis proposal places a 4 WETH order on CowSwap for DXD.

See Proposal 1. ​​\n- Continued contributor assistance with company formation and immigration questions.\n- Explore solutions to Contributor Invoicing issues and legal entity formation.\n- Create proposal on Self-Insurance Fund to cover potential defenses and damages in a suit or regulatory action.\n- LisCON networking with various DAO legal advisors on areas of interest that could helps with DXdao’s needs.\n\n**15% DXventures / DXbiz**\n\n- Attend and review pitches for DXventures.\n- Network with DeFI community projects for possible opportunities for collaboration with DXdao.\n- Draft and review terms for any grant proposals for DXventures.\n\n**5% Omen:**\n\n- Finish the creation of the Omen video for the landing page with Ilio.\n\n**Self Evaluation:** The following is a self-evaluation on what I’ve done well, okay, and not well. This work proposal is coming at a week before the end of the current proposed work period. So it will be evaluating the proposed projects and deliverables stated above.\n\n**Did Well:**\n\n- Creating a Q4 budget was very nice to organize and plan DXdao legal priorities for the end of the year. Each item is currently being worked on, with the exception of the blockchain analysis. I’ve had a really difficult time pinning down the firm to a price, and may be exploring other options.\n- The UK opinion has been delivered, advice from Polsinelli has been useful, and steps to start the exploration with MME are underway, but not yet initiated.\n- A big step in progress in this work period has been around contributor payments, immigration, and a potential Self-Insurance fund. These are all areas that I think will help DXdao scale and sustainably grow.\n- Also, please look out for a proposal to cover a retroactive stipend to cover costs for setting up a legal entity to interact with the DAO. The aim is to incentivize DXdao contributors to set these entities up as a healthy method to interact not just with this DAO, but all DAOs.\n\n**Did Okay:** \n- Getting feedback on product development has been active, but more streamlined processes with individual product leads need to be developed to assess legal needs and find the proper contractors to cover any missing gaps. I’m happy to have started creating those channels, with DXvote, for example, but more needs to be done to assess and stay up-to-date on the product side. More regular and streamlined communication with product leads, perhaps a 30 minute weekly check-in, could be a nice step.\n\n**Needs Improvement:**\n- I’m late on this proposal, very late. I know we’ve discussed a potential deduction in payment for late proposals. I would be okay with accepting a deduction if others think it’s a good idea to do so.\n- I have also backed off on some of my responsibilities with DXventures in order to focus more on general DAO legal structuring and narrow my focus. The Chainverse proposal was a missed opportunity IMO, and I still need to make a formal proposal for Atlantis World. - - This may come before the work period is over, but it should have been done sooner.\n- Clearer documentation on the Contributor UX side for legal resources needs to be thought about. There’s a lot of ad hoc answering of questions happening, but some basic materials in the DXdocs could help some through basic questions.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\nExperience Level: 5\n\nFull-time for total of 40 hours per week, for two months (9.13.21 - 11.12.21).\n\n$16,000 (DAI) to be paid at the end of the work period\n$12,000 (DXD). $6,000 (DXD) vested at 1 year, and continued vesting after the first year on a linear schedule.\n0.3334% REP\n\n**Additional Requests for Reimbursement:**\n\n- LisCON + DXRetreat Travel ($300 – rental car) and Stay Stipend ($800): $1100\n- Reimbursement for the cost of 3 months of the Bloomberg Law Subscription (legal research tool) : $1738\nI presented obtaining this subscription about six months back during a governance call. I use this to research topics on legal questions for DXdao. I’ve claimed a reimbursement for it once previously. I’ve found it helpful to have the most accurate and up-to-date information on fintech legal issues, as well as see what other projects have been doing for legal frameworks.\n\nI joined DXdao as a part-time contributor as of 12/12/20. Prior to this, I, along with my partner under @pulpmachina, contributed for two (2) months through DAOtalk topic posts, meeting participation, and Keybase / Telegram discussions.

From tokenomics to Lisbon Metahub access and setup, the people in Dawn will be part of the DAOist's most vital decisions.\n\nTHE LISBON METAHUB - A cryptonative political IRL space working on outreach, education and publishing for all DAOs.\n\nThe Lisbon metahub will host art, tech and policy residencies to create cultural public goods, accelerate DAO2DAO collaboration, and tailor future “The DAOist” & “Global Governance Gathering” experiences.\n\nThis is an immediate opportunity for DXdao to secure a Ministry slot at $25k.\n\n**Important Details (Please read documents)**\n\nYou can learn more about Dawn in this mirror post about [Governing Dawn](https://thedaoist.mirror.xyz/iBli1bThLR5FwgO47S-2c2Wj-Bvw4sTmSM_uB9esftY).\n\nCheck out the [site](https://www.thedaoist.co/dawn#ministry) and [deck](https://pitch.com/public/acb0b6a1-f85d-4cdd-b9e9-9fccecff67b4).\n\nThis is also a draft of the invitation for DXdao to become a Ministry: [Ministry Invitation and FAQs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13H3tI8M0VBPH3mpq0kDG0GmJDBO3brJT20Kj1rYDB0Q/edit)\n\nYou can check the full overview of Dawn Governors [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y5QpeJnRNcYcYJH9jULmSAng-8ISG2C2KKWbK2Ni5dY/edit#gid=0).\n\nDXdao currently has governance power in Dawn due to:\n\n1. Support of the DAOist Paris: Sister DAO (10 awarded retroactively at Dawn Launch)\n2. Support of the DAOist Lisbon: Ride or DAO (25 awarded retroactively at Dawn Launch)\n3. Likely some additional governance due to support of GGG: Patron (does not have a set governance reward; TBD by Dawn)\n\nThis docs also provides some answers to our follow-up questions: [Ministry clarifications for DXdao](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZnIlNFb831clZPZJrbkmlWckhGv_4Cxl59q1zhZ7lRg/edit)\n\nIn Dawn, 6 Core Tokens have been given to core DAOist contributors.\n\nThe Core token is conditionally granted to people who are devoting most of their time to the project, ideally full time or at least 50% of their work capacity and participating in the specific verticals of the project.\n\nThese people are:\n- Elco, (born Felipe Duarte)\n- Inga Vyugova\n- Luuk Weber\n- Numa Oliveira\n- Guil\n- Stefen Deleveaux\n\n$280k (about 34%) of the $825k funding will fund the **larger** core team to advance The DAOist.\n\nUPDATE from THE DAOist:\n\"**Q: Does the core team have their own ideas for future creations and opportunities?**  \nA: The Core team funding is actually misnamed - it's \"all team funding\" = since the creation of that deck the team has grown around 2x between events support and local comms / production team in Portugal\n\n**Q: Are there plans from The DAOist team?**\nA: We have several ideas underway on the 3 tracks of Tech, Art/Culture, and Governance - Looking forward to being able to put them on a roadmap and check warmness with the community - initial planned use of Dawn will be related to setting the political frame and main agreements as per stated in the governing Dawn article, but governance holders can make their own proposals.\"\n\n**Some reasons to support:**\n\n1. Lean into The DAOist and Dawn as one of the best DAO-focused orgs and events organizer in the space, plus more\n2. Additional voting power in the Dawn DAO that sets the future path of what The DAOist does\n3. Optimal access to future events\n4. Additional Perks:\n\n**What governance is included with the Ministry package?**\n\n* Ministry Badge NFT for your organization + Set of Delegate NFTs totaling 50 votes (25+25)\n* Delegate tokens remain transferable\n\n**What DAOist event perks are included for Ministries?**\n\n* Priority access to additional DAOist tickets before releasing to the general public. (The DAOist events are often free and curated - by securing a ministry you know you will always be in)\n\n**What Lisbon Metahub perks are included for Ministries?**\n\n* Coworking + Dormitory access for “delegate” token holders (subject to availability)\n* Priority for ‘Residency Program’ agenda setting - effectively a perennial plug and play off site space for inter and intra team collaboration to speed up your projects ship rate - including on staff documentation team to publish the process and results of the co creation.\n\n**Will the Ministry slot need to be re-purchased at a later date?**\n\n* The benefits described here do not have an expiration date. The runway generated by this sponsorship set should be able to fund the DAOist’s path to sustainability by fleshing out several revenue streams with events, services and products instead of resales involving Dawn Governance.\n* Any other decisions will be made by the DAO. It will still retain 49.6% of the total agreed supply of governance power after sponsorship slots are sold.\n\n5. Continue to build a much stronger network of DAO-focused entities in the space.\n\n**Some costs / risks:**\n\n1. Cost would be $25k tribute to have this spot in Dawn\n2. How to determine delegates to represent DXdao in Dawn. DXdao has not done much like this, but it IS something DXdao should get much better at -> delegating representation into other communities\n3. Unsure of use of some of the benefits - because the Metahub is regional, may only be available to be taken advantage of by select few contributors\n\nThe entire space needs more high quality events around DAOs and these events need participants who are leading the way in decentralization.  Supporting this initiative would allow DXdao to continue to set examples and share its ideas with the community.   \n\nIf you support this Opportunity, please signal your support by vote.  \n","title":"Signal Proposal: DXdao to commit to Ministry position in Dawn DAO organized by The DAOist","hash":"QmWntW4o6Tkcnm6BGAHT5M3nik9r1tnVvPDX9gtYAnxenS"},"0x1f808b73c8c8fd14caa59ac3a25a1106f7f36adaee64f905f63962d17ba65954":{"description":"This proposal launches a HAUS / WETH farming campaign that starts Thu June 9th 2022 at 15:00 and ends Thu July 7th 2022 at 15:00; distributing 11200 SWPR tokens over that time period.\n\nREP holders approved the SWPR token and farming campaigns through a [signal proposal](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x2d00135332c28271ba27c6f02f9aa79a480b4d7c58df37fb30e6a55353470910) that passed in August of 2021.

As per my worker proposal I will be requesting the second payout here.\n\nUnfortunately, web dev human resources became scarce in Omen, and other teams, which makes it very difficult, quite impossible, to mentor a junior developer as I am. And so I won’t be continuing contributing. Though, I learned a ton and I am immensely grateful for the opportunity DXdao handed me 3 months ago. I will tell everyone goodbye during today’s gov call.\n\nAs I started with Omen, a couple of weeks before my contribution period initiated, digging inside the codebase and coding tiny tasks I felt confident I could overcome the challenge Omen development represented. But starting a web dev career within a dao, where the environment pushes you to be as independent as possible, rapidly turned out wrong for me and for my ‘negative’ spillovers, or at least recurrent cumbersome questions, to the team. After fighting with git, learning deeper react, styled components, understanding the latest way of writing js code, the way Omen code is pushed, collaborated on, I still managed to contribute at my modest, beginner level.\n\nMassive kudos to @Violet which, despite having loads on his plate, took the time to answer my beginners questions and review all my PRs. Thank you @geronimo and @Melanie for giving me the opportunity to be part of the team and assist me.\n\nI still feel very lucky because within 3months of experience at DXdao I managed to meet most of you in Paris while many of you never had that chance in years. I am blessed I took part in it, and this is probably not a farewell since I’m sure we’ll cross path again. DXdao has great talents, powerful ideas and a super product suite. I wish you to deliver great management and make the best out of it.\n\nWork done\n\nThe main objectives I worked on were the refactoring of styles and some OMN airdrop front-end feature.\nHere are all my PRs.

Logging the investigations in the Notion board for initial research and brainstorming.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MO3Fr88.png)\n\nI have also started working on the Q3 roadmap along with Zett. We would do a similar exercise with the devs to figure out the estimations and what makes sense to be scoped into the Q3 roadmap. This is still a WIP and a lot could change from what is in the stickies here right now.\n\nWe will also have a seperate discussion with the devs to figure out the refactoring scope for the dapp. The feedback from the devs is that we should probably address this sooner to make way for faster product development in the future.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/07XrNne.jpg)\n\n\n**DxStats:**\nWe also made a DxStats [release 1.5.0 ](https://github.com/SwaprDAO/swapr-info/releases/tag/v1.5.0)that included multichain dashboard, improved performance and a better typography.\nFor the next release, we will also be working on new stats that will go into the dashboard page, more bug fixes and performance improvements.\nWe are also getting help from Boris (UX designer) to do a small redesign to make it look in alignment with Swapr design.\n\n**For the month of June:**\nA good goal for the month of June would be to facilitate and finalise the Q3 roadmap for product development, contracts and refactoring, release of Beta 13.\n\n**Compensation:**\nFor the month of May, I would like to be compensated 7459 WXDAI as I had taken 1.5 days off due to travelling and vacation.

[According to the most recent on-chain data and estimates](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmU1gB6iJbEgxK2BF9ugmH4LSzmwqSA934jb8Y3aieTwtk), DXD has averaged $134k over the last 3 months, so this proposal sends 10.58 WETH to the GP relayer on xDai, identified as `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`, using a [$3166.35 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum). Further explanation of the [GP relayer can be found here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmd8TCEr6syKxAnmuBH3hsyvxfSgRJgANLTTorp3JGZY77). \n\nThis proposal falls under the DXD Buyback Program, because the value of the DXD circulating supply is less than the value in the ETH in DXdao’s treasury, [according to Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dxdao) and [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa1d65E8fB6e87b60FECCBc582F7f97804B725521).\n\nThis proposal sends funds to the GP Relayer. A separate proposal with the order parameters must also be submitted to place the order. That proposal must be executed _after_ this proposal or else it will fail.","title":"Send 10.58 WETH to GP Relayer for xDXD buyback #27","hash":"QmcC8DU9myLTLpyFRZQmGMqu1pWubkfWERc55VKd4JSDwW"},"0x336d24eacc7e59def5c62d5f221512a431be7c9e519187dd79274c36db1c5009":{"description":"*Proposal below would approve the 1H 2023 Operations Guild Budget.

The proposed thresholds for the 2023 H2 period are:\n\n* attend (10) governance calls and…\n* vote in at least (1) proposal per month (6 total).\n\nAll individuals with more than 0.5% of total REP are welcome to register to be a Steward. Stewards are eligible to earn up to $1500 USD & DXD per budgetary period, but if there are more than 10 who apply and meet all thresholds then the total pool will be evenly split between all eligible stewards. This is a contingency request in this proposal and will be outlined in a separate forum post.\n\n\n## Guild Personnel\n\nIndividual contributor lists, contributor level information per [approved guidelines](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xaa3c6d9953d5510a0f014f946e94f03f07a4e5259718e86f07d41d255917e410), and time commitment as percentage of full time.\n\n|Contributor|Level|Time Commitment|Description of Role|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Caney Fork|Level 8|30 hrs/week|Primary host of weekly governance call, drafts proposals, spreadsheets and helps coordinate amongst major stakeholders in DXdao.

During that time, I automated several tasks using Python and PowerQuery, and wrote documentation, standardized and implemented the Kanban methodology on various business processes.\n\nIn 2021, I decided to switch careers and focus on learning the JavaScript stack during off-work hours and weekends, finally going full-time on learning in December and starting a bootcamp in January 2022.\n\nMy whole life I’ve been tech-oriented. I wrote my first line of code when I was 13 and had been programming on and off since then. When Bitcoin was starting, I remember trying to set up a mining node on an old HP laptop (I don’t know if I succeeded, but who knows, maybe there’s a laptop somewhere worth a couple of bitcoins).\n\nI’m interested in blockchain development to translate current governance processes into a robust decentralized system.

If successful, they may be a lower-cost engagement (with specialties) than a full-time DAO Counsel. Working with Dave and Melanie on this.\n* Moving!

I think it’s in the right direction and “okay” because it took a while.\n* [DXdao Budget 2H2022](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-budget-2h2022/4394) After the DXdao expenses [post](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-expenses-update-june-2022/4285) from Caney Fork’s last worker proposal, squad leads worked on their own individual budgets, which I then consolidated into a [comprehensive line-item 6 month budget](https://dxgov.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma25yTiKpZTv4eZT7oMywtpifsBzKzDJ4yz3V31cXZqXT).

After reviewing my scope of contribution and past work, Martin suggested that it is appropriate at this time to raise my level due to the value of my contributions to Mesa. Moving forward, I will continue and be held responsible for providing contributions to Mesa and the community at this level.\n\n# Background\n\nPlease refer to the [Background section of Contributor Proposal for Q1 2021](https://daotalk.org/t/draft-worker-proposal-adam-azad-q1-2021/2659#background)\n\n# Timeframe and Scope\n\n**Timeframe**\n\nApril 1st to May 31st, 2021\n\n**Proposed Scope of Contribution**\n\n* Goals:\n  * Development of the Mesa ecosystem including products, vision, and tokenomics.\n  * Help onboard new developers for Mesa since I am going part-time starting June 1st.\n  * Work on Mesa SDK (first proposed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vh_CbZAo5vsSRrYYkPVHdpU9vAbPd1pDOCPNhoVzUpk/edit#slide=id.p)).\n* Responsibilities:\n  * Review PRs on [mesa-interface](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-interface) since I would be more focused on smart contracts and integration. In May, I shall go back to coding on the frontend.\n  * Focus on the subgraph updates with the new release of [Mesa smart contracts](https://github.com/cryptonative-ch/mesa-smartcontracts/pull/55).\n  * Coordinate the delivery of the MVP with Martin Krung.\n  * Write developer and contribution documents for the Mesa ecosystem. We have 5+ active repos on GitHub.\n  * Integrate the contracts on the front end.\n  * Review and submit general improvements to the contracts.\n\n# Self-Reflection\n\n* Did well\n  * The delivery of Mesa SDK. The multicalls the SDK provides will save many steps in building the Mesa Dashboard.\n  * A better understanding of the Mesa smart contracts. Not just how it works, but to develop on top of the current release. My goal is to think about tokenomics for Mesa.\n  * I am the Mesa Subgraph Jedi now. Been diving in the contracts deep and the graph docs\n  * Provide a better IDE for future potential developers in Mesa through some contributions Martin mentioned in his [Tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/martinkrung/status/1399750827158523905https://twitter.com/martinkrung/status/1399750827158523905) :)\n  * Communication with the Mesa team and the DAO members in general. Fun fact: I was on a date in Amman and got carried out, and didn’t produce much for that day. You know, it’s life and happens. I later communicated this to my squad as code of conduct. Life happens, you know :D\n* Did okay\n  * DevOps and contribution documents are something I wanted to focus on as my last month full-time, knowing that I have to hand over the workload to new developers. The current docs are sufficient but lack great technical details I want to elaborate on over the next coming weeks.\n  * Helping Martin with the sprint management. I am not a certified PM/PO, but I have helped him when I could.\n* Improve on\n  * Fix the silo situation in the squad. This is something we’ve noticed in the squad. It’s a collective effort to be transparent and communicative.\n  * Time estimations and promises to Squad Leader. I am somehow over-optimistic about a delivery, but manage to deliver 80-90% of what I promised to deliver for the given sprint (we use Scrum Kanban via Trello at Mesa). We switched to Zenhub with GitHub integration to give estimates for tasks. It should help us stay focused.\n  * Over-committing to certain technical blocks. We had PRs open for more than 4-6 days sometimes, which means deviation of the sprint target.\n\n## Proof of work on GitHub\n\n* [April](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2021-04-01&to=2021-04-30)\n* [May](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2021-05-01&to=2021-05-31)\n\n# Compensation\n  * Experience Level: 4\n  * Time commitment: Full-time (100%\n  * 14,000 DAI: For 2 months of work at level 4 to be paid in one retroactive payout proposal.\n  * 19.12 DXD: Vested for 2 years with a 1-year cliff starting April 1st, 2021. 9.56 DXD per month.\n  * 5,143.2 REP: For 2 months of work, to be paid in two retroactive payout proposals.\n\n![|624x329](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dJNwl_hI19U_1BUl45tR3K9SPIvmdSH0Wjl4CBsEan5sswWoU0bU9xeOf1FmL172Hj-0Ub9odVLEBQmuoS9i_-PNuqA1YVbOJPxPS0cRdXWbMvKIlgQ_BEfsxS2GyR82UiXfZNGV)\n\n# Work Experience\n\n* Prior DXdao work proposals\n  * [[Draft] Worker Proposal, Adam Azad - Q1 2021](https://daotalk.org/t/draft-worker-proposal-adam-azad-q1-2021/2659/3)\n  * [Trial Worker Proposal - Adam Azad - January 13-27th, 2021](https://daotalk.org/t/trial-worker-proposal-adam-azad-january-13-27th-2021/2829/2)\n  * [Worker Proposal - Adam Azad - February 2021](https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-adam-azad-february-2021/2831/2)\n  * [[Draft] Worker Proposal Payout - Adam Azad - March 2021](https://daotalk.org/t/draft-worker-proposal-payout-adam-azad-march-2021/2948/2)\n* Past Work for DXdao\n  * [January contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2021-01-01&to=2021-01-31)\n  * [February contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2021-02-01&to=2021-02-28)\n  * [March contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/adamazad?tab=overview&from=2021-03-01&to=2021-03-31)","title":"Adam Azad - Contributor Payout Proposal - April 1st - May 31st 2021","hash":"QmUNn7Am5FFGeaeMvt2P4P7Z17eRNcskkrQs9cvdVf2K27"},"0x3c45ec8350034b7937bf3d6aa624c378e6e75b3a7766f954fd893af2b223f2c3":{"description":"Caney Fork has earned mainnet REP that has not synced with Gnosis Chain.

We have deadlines in place to get DXdocs V1.0 ready within roughly a week of this post going live.\n- This period I, more-so than previously, have been leading the organizational tasks for the Communications and Marketing squad. While I am personally not fully satisfied with our Marketing output in the previous period, I believe that we did a fantastic job given the various factors at play. (My time/focus was spread too wide, we had a lack of manpower and expenditure - lessened further by the loss of a squad member, etc…) We are also taking the right steps to rectify the present issues, through the onboarding of Caden and Kyle, and recruitment of a Senior marketing lead through PositionCo.\n\n### Things I think I could improve on:\n\n- I took on too wide of a responsibility pool and found myself stretched thin. There was a window where I found myself contributing much more than 40h/w, and made myself available from waking until sleep on Keybase/Discord/etc, which definitely wasn’t healthy and affected me personally. Massive thank you to those that recognised it and sent encouraging messages, I really appreciate it. I’d like to improve on this by adhering closer to an 8h window of availability, which I aim to ease into as the marketing and communications squad builds out.\n- I think I could have done more as a community leader. Particularly I had found that other urgent priorities superseded the windows I prepared to focus on the community. The solution here, related to the above, is to ensure I am not taking on more responsibilities than I have time to complete as an individual, and leveraging the growing communications and marketing squad when possible to free additional time.\n\n## Compensation:\n\nExperience Level: 4\n\nFull-time.\n\n- Month one.\n  - $7,036 (xDai).\n  - $5,000 (DXD).

I was able to complete more tasks I also feel I have gained more independence and I can bring more value to the team/project through my contributions.\nThis proposal does not vary much from the previous ones. The focus will remain on continuing Guilds development and supporting dxVote. Depending on what the QA team's idea is, I'd like to add some more integration tests for features we already have and it would be nice to verify that they don't break. Also, the audit report for guilds contracts should be ready so at some of this timeframe so my guess is that it will be a priority.\n\n## ****Goals:****\n\n- Collaborate with the dxGov team on the dxVote/guilds dapp by working on any issue(s) and/or feature(s) that the team leader sees fit for me.\n- Continue learning more about web3 and solidity development in general\n- Continue contributing to the dxdao-contracts repo by working on the issues of the new audit report.\n- Now that synpress implementation is done, I would like to join efforts with QA team to create a plan for integration tests.\n\n## **Responsibilities:**\n\nCollaborate with the dxgov team to build Guilds MPV and support dxvote\n\n## **Timeframe:**\n\n2 months. From May 30, 2022, to Jul 24, 2022.\n\n## ****Compensation:****\n\n**Experience Level:** \n\nLevel 4\n\n**Time commitment:** \n\nFull-time ( 40hs/week )\n\n**Payment:** \n- $12000 DAI\n- $8000 DXD vested for 3 years.\n- 0.3334% REP\n\nTo be paid 50% at the half of the period and 50% at the end of this period\nThis proposal is for the last 50%. \n- 6000 xDai\n- 3464 REP ( 2077783 * 0.001667 ) ;\n\n## Work Experience:\n[Daotalk - Worker proposal [04/04/2022 - 29/05/2022]](https://daotalk.org/t/milton-contributor-proposal-04-04-2022-29-05-2022/4116?u=milton)  \n[Daotalk - Worker proposal [07/02/2022 - 03/04/2022]](https://daotalk.org/t/milton-contributor-proposal-07-02-2022-03-04-2022/4003)  \n[Daotalk - Worker proposal [13/12/2021 - 06/02/2022]](https://daotalk.org/t/milton-contributor-proposal-13-12-2021-06-02-2022-trial-period/3793)  \n[Daotalk - Worker proposal [29/11/2021 - 10/12/2021]](https://daotalk.org/t/milton-contributor-proposal-29-11-2021-10-12-2021-trial-period/3686)  \nSee contributions on [Github](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3AMiltonTulli)  \n\n## \n## Period review\n\nAt the beginning of this period, we created a new project (fork of dxvote) to gradually leave dxvote code behind and prioritize guilds codebase. Due to this, for several weeks the focus was  refactoring the code to align it with the new \"standards” ( file/folder structure, unit testing, storybook, etc). I feel like our discussions and working sessions finally materialized into good results in our code. \nI think my productivity was very good, focused on DAVI project for a large amount of time, but also contributed to the dxdao contracts repo (mainly guild contracts) for the audit report issues.\n\n### Went well:  \n- The discussions about the refactor were very good. I think I was able to contribute to them. Now, after having finished a large part of the refactoring work, I see that these discussions/meetings were vital to be able to raise the level of our codebase, making it more readable, debuggable and standardized. Also (and it's not a minor thing) were very good to unite the team in technical criteria. I think we still need to improve our codebase but this was a great step.\n- I made some contributions to dxdao-contracts (guilds contracts). Personally, that was great since allowed me to be in touch with our core logic and the benefit of that was instant. I worked a lot on BaseErc20Guild contract so after that I have been able, for example, to make some fixes on proposal creation flow (voting mechanism, action calls, etc) on guilds completely sure of what is happening behind. Over time, that knowledge will naturally give me more confidence to solve bigger problems and make better decisions. I hope I can continue with it.\n- This is not something that specifically I have done well, but as a group we were able to meet in person to work with @AugustoL  and @dinocres  (dxgov team). I think that it is very important to be able to maintain this practice with some regularity, since having good relationships helps a lot with work dynamics, especially when things are not going well.\n\n### I can improve on:\n\n- In my previous period I was very excited about having integration tests setup and with the addition of the QA team I thought they would continue on that task. Maybe it was not in their priorities/plan since they are doing manual testing for now. While there isn't much I can do other than be available for when they want to get started with integration test, I think I could have done a better job by joining their weekly meetings to help speed up their process.\n- As a personal note I would add that I am still looking for the balance between the life of the dao and my work. I feel that if I pay a lot of attention to the chats/communications (in addition to my daily and meetings with the dxgov team that I attend religiously) and surely it impacts my productivity. I think this period in particular was quite productive and one of the reasons is that I didn't pay much attention to the chats. This leaves me out of many movements that are taking place, so I will continue working on that balance to be able to participate more in the dao, not because it is something I feel I must/should dom, but because it is something I want to.\n\n### Period contributions:\n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/6](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/6)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/7](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/7)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/29](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/29)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/35](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/35)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/36](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/36)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/41](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/41)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/42](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/42)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/50](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/50)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/55](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/55)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/80](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/80)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/81](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/81)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/90](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/90)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/106](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/106)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/137](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/pull/137)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/181](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/181)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/182](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/182)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/184](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/184)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/188](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/188)  \n[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/194](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/194)  ","title":"Milton Contributor Proposal [30/05/2022 - 24/07/2022] (Part 2)","hash":"QmXskrTRTpo6Pf8W8DeC6RnXvTMbJ6dJ2WDvhZ8gc2ZC8m"},"0x4c87360f51d53256be331f459bdcebd659e2368d30ca9441c8b84cfe1bc38304":{"description":"I am submitting a proposal for current ongoing and future contributions to DXdao that started on January 1st, 2022, and will end on February 28th, 2022, with full-time capacity as of Feb 12th, 2022.

Previous notes used by the community can be seen on the DXdao's Mainnet base.\n\n**Goals**\n\n- Improve Swapr's Dapp codebase health. This topic has been on my radar for so long now, without much bandwidth to pursue it. Diogo brought it up again, and now I'm confident we can formalize a plan together.\n- Help with Uniswap v3 Eco Router integration. Jorge is mostly investigating this topic, but I am available to help get more confident with working with contracts and integrating this.\n- Coordinate efforts with SpaceInch to review and finish Eco Bridge.

This was released as of [v1.2.0](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-sdk/releases/tag/v1.2.0-beta.0)\n- Released Swapr SDK [v1.2.0](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-sdk/releases/tag/v1.2.0-beta.0), [v1.3.0](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-sdk/releases/tag/v1.3.0-beta.3), and [v1.4.3](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-sdk/releases/tag/v1.4.3-beta.0)\n- Prepared and release Swapr [Beta 12](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.12) and [Beta 13](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.13)\n- [Added Uniswap v3 support for Mainnet, Arbtirum, and Polygon as of Swapr Beta 13.](https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.13)\n- [Recapped all development updates on DXdao Dev Community Call. Past and future updates are on Notion](https://www.notion.so/Swapr-Dev-Community-Call-Highlights-28ffd6905085433ba7a5a4c8fab825e7)\n- Day-to-day responsibilities can be seen on GitHub.\n\nDid Well:\n\n- Uniswap v3 support in EcoRouter. The community feedback was ok\n- Reviewing EcoBridge PR from SpaceInch.\n- Dev Community Highlights. It's more or less a weekly newsletter about everything happening with Swapr\n\nDid okay\n\n- SDK releases happen in faster sprints.\n- Onboarding Jorge: one of my reviewers in the bi-anuual review was Jorge. Yet, I think we can do a better job in onboarding new developers. \n\nNeeds improvement:\n\n- Reduce time between releases: It took 56 days between Beta 12 and Beta 13. But it took 28 days between Beta 13 and Beta 14. This is not ideal and can be better. My goal for the next proposal is a stable release every 15 days on average.","title":"Adam Azad - Contributor Proposal May to June 2022","hash":"QmfYDtpcERZzr72vWCtpgqH8nXex9heAAfEjf6yERQtJfq"},"0x5031bca4a8f68ba19fdf6f2d302ba69b7eec3d5761c4f3420b391b035eda9ac6":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

We have been discussing the use of Coordinape for quite some time, and it finally came to life in the first quarter of 2022. The process was almost seamless and well adapted by DXdao contributors. I look forward to continuing the use of this DAO tool as one of the many ways to reward our active, valuable contributors.\n\nWith the big support of @violet, @nylon, @zett and @luzzifoss we were able to recruit 8 new contributors to DXdao over the past 2 months. Big thank you! It is great to see our product teams growing to help us reach our goals.\n\nWhat I can improve on:\n\nAlthough I can say ETHDenver was a success overall, there were still areas of improvement that I have identified for myself. Increased attention to detail and communication should have been given to DXdao contributors for the ETHDenver Buidlathon. This would have prevented a few hiccups during the buidler judging and award distribution phases. Despite this, I think we are in a good rhythm of planning and attending conferences/events with our community.\n\nOnboarding new contributors was a bit challenging during this period. Two main factors caused this: 1. Number of new contributors onboarding was higher than usual (a good problem to have) and 2. ETHDenver - balancing the coordination of the conference. Moving forward, I will improve strategy on how many new contributors we can support onboarding at any given time.\n\nCompensation:\n\nThis proposal falls under the new compensation structure enacted from 01/01/2022\n\n- Level 6\n- Time commitment- 100%\n- Contributing to DXdao since 3/22/2021\n-Full-time for total of 40 hours per week, for two months (4/1/2022-5/30/2022)\n\nMonth 1\n\n- $8,000 (xDAI)\n- $6,000 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n- 0.1667% REP\n\nMonth 2\n\n- $8,000 (xDAI)\n- $6,000 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n- 0.1667% REP\n- I will be attending Devconnect from April 15th-24th and requesting my Devconnect contributor stipend in my month 2 (end) proposal. Details of totals will be outlined in my reflection.\n\n\n\n","title":" Melanie Contributor Proposal 4/1/22 - 5/31/22","hash":"QmcHgBtCVjFcdbG8LSqTub1aCfAmJ9W9ctmKxufxnRUdBJ"},"0x52c90416b88701ea09a44b0bd9bed5c7ea6db5cece2d28cb1456a7da668afc16":{"description":"\nBelow is a scope of work to be done from February 1, 2022 - March 31st, 2022 for Caney Fork LLC.

I know that I mention this on all of my worker proposals, so I will not go into detail here, but I just can’t help saying that it is still an amazing experience to me, this “time” thing in web3.\n\nWith DEVCon around the corner, I am very excited to see everyone again (and to meet the few people I have not yet met), to attend the Infinite Hackathon and to get to spend some more personal time with everyone in Cartagena. It is really going to be great, and as we get closer to the date it seems that ETH Bogotá is going to be BIG. Momentum is building and I can see it on the feeds, chats and channels.\n\nWith nearly every DXdao contributor descending on ETH Bogotá, we’ll be a force to be reckoned with, and with Nimi in our midst, I am super excited. To side-track a little, I really love Nimi and think it is an awesome product and idea. I love using my Nimi profile. It was so funny to see the recent tweets from the Nimi account of Dave with the bag over his head and Adam the Boss sitting pounding away at that Mac. They were awesome!\n\nI mentioned it in my last proposal, but I think it is worth repeating. DXdao’s contributors are an amazing group of individuals. I feel privileged to be around you all and to have this opportunity to learn from you.\n\nThank you all once again and as always, I welcome any feedback, notes or criticism.\n\n**Role:**\nSocial Media and Community Growth Contributor\n**Time frame:**\n2 Month Period - 26.09.2022 - 25.11.2022 (40 hours/week)\n\n## Reflection on goals and responsibilities:\n**What I think I did well in relation to my goals:**\n*Improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products\n*\nAs stated before this is my favorite objective and, even though this is a moving target, I am still 100% committed to this and adding to my knowledge all the time. I realized now when I was attending ETHWarsaw that I could draw on information about Swapr and Carrot without trouble and present it in a way that is both understandable to the recipients, as well as flattering to the product and the team building it. This was a great realization after I received my first “So what makes your DEX/AMM different from all the other ones on the market?” and “so what does DXdao do?”. FYI, when asked what DXdao does, I said “we grow Carrots and take care of Monsters” - people loved that answer, especially when I went on to explain the products behind that cheeky answer.\n\n*Continue clarifying existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities and take them on as my “own”.*\n\nTaking responsibility for the areas that one would deem fall under my purview has always been one of my primary objectives and one that I take very seriously. Organizations usually fill positions for two reasons. One, the need to have the work done and two, to alleviate the stress and workload of existing personnel who are currently fulfilling those obligations. It was therefore paramount that I clearly identify and take over these responsibilities. In my assessment, based on the feedback from my peers, this goal has been achieved. Since it is an ongoing activity, I will remain vigilant in maintaining this level of commitment and output.\n\n*Get to know the remaining key contributors that I have not yet met.*\n\nParis was a wonderful opportunity to meet all the contributors that I had not yet met. Specifically @KeenanL and @international.blue with whom I work closely on a regular basis. Personal contact is truly important for fostering sound working relationships, I am REALLY looking forward to seeing the “whole” of DXdao. It seems that we will be short only one or two contributors who won’t be attending, so it is bound to be an amazing experience.\n\nI would add that I do not think it a bad idea for us to have occasional calls with our cameras on, for two reasons: visual representation of what we are saying helps with communication, and it usually does not extend meetings beyond their point of usefulness keeping meeting short and sweet. Either way, just a thought.\n\n**What I think I did well in relation to my Responsibilities:**\n*Continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere:*\n\nI do not see this changing as a focal point for me as this plays a major role in DXdao’s communications and notification structure. It is also the primary reason I was taken on by the DAO and I must say that I am very happy with how things are going here. As the needs of the DAO become clearer and my knowledge expands, I am able to deliver better and more consistently. This is my favorite part of the work (other than meeting you all at conferences that is), and I look forward to expanding and growing here.\n\nI continue to make a point of focusing on the 1:10 post to engagement ratio and actively seek out mentions and content related to the DAO, its products and contributors. This engagement is also increasing in quality as my knowledge of DXdao and the ecosystem has grown.\n\n*Communications:*\n\nAs I stated in my previous proposal, creating content for DXdao on a more consistent basis was a personal objective of mine. I made it a point during this proposal to help in the content creation and was very happy to be a part of a lot of the work that went out over the past two months. There are even some articles in backlog waiting for the right time to be published. With ETH Bogota coming up, front-run by Infinite, I can only imagine all the juicy bits and pieces I will be able to gather and put together. It is bound to be great! Please wear your “Do Not Photograph” sticker around me at all times if you do not want photos taken and if you go on stage, well then I have to say that it’s fair game.\n\n**What I think needs improvement in relation to my Responsibilities**\n*Time Management:*\nI am still spending 10-12 hours a day, Monday to Friday, with a few hours each on Saturdays and Sundays sitting in front of the computer. I mentioned in my last proposal that I have built up this habit and while I do go to sleep slightly earlier, this has only slightly improved. I need to pay more attention to this and will continue to focus on this over the next two months to make sure I remain productive. Right now it does not seem like burn-out can affect me, but I have been warned to be careful. Thank you to those of you who have cautioned me of this.\n\n*Social Engagement:*\nIn the past I have always made it a priority to highlight our contributors’ engagement with the greater web3 community. Be it on stage, on Twitter or a podcast. I think this is very important and good for the DAO on many levels. It highlights to the outside world that we support our contributors and their actions while representing the DAO. It shows our contributors that we as a community support and value them and lastly, it always gives me an opportunity to learn more about the DAO, about the person presenting and the space in general.\n\nWith everything leading up to ETH Paris and shortly after, time was in short supply and I was not able to highlight three events. We had a multitude of other initiatives and announcements that kept taking precedence over these and because I did not plan time allocations for unexpected events, I found myself unable to get them out. I am not happy about this for the professional reasons above and for personal reasons.\n\nThis needs attention and I will say that I have established a new routine that allows for allotting time to “unexpected events” when I know there have been appearances from contributors. Murphy’s law, I was recently presented with similar conditions to the time surrounding ETH Paris, so it was a great time to test this new routine. While there was a little pressure, I still had available time and I was able to push out the work I wanted to get out. I hope to see continued and increased success with this in the future.\n\n## Goals:\n\n1. Continue to improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products and services.\n\n2. Maintain existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities.\n\n3. Continue to contribute to the DXvoice squad in a flexible manner which adds value to the squad and to the greater DAO.\n\n## Responsibilities:\nContinue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere.\n\n- Devise relevant Twitter Campaigns with relevant parties.\n- Maintain a constant information stream relevant to the product and its users.\n\nSocial Engagement:\n\n- Help increase awareness of DXdao and its products, and drive social engagement with the relevant DXdao Twitter accounts.\n- Continue to assist in generating content supporting the activities of the DAO to add to the relevant mediums deemed acceptable by DXdao.\n- Identify and analyze competitors, complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on Twitter and Discord.\n\nGrowth Marketing:\n\n- Analyze data and track metrics of tweets to determine what is working, what is not, and to optimize tweets according to the target audience.\n\nCommunications:\n\n- Assist with ideating and executing campaigns across owned and other media channels, as needed.\n\n**Previous proposals:**\n[25.01.2022 - 04.04.2022: 2.5 month Trial period](https://daotalk.org/t/waynes-worker-proposal-trial-period-late-jan-2022-to-early-april-2022/3939/5)\n[05.04.2022 - 30.05.2022](https://daotalk.org/t/waynes-worker-proposal-early-april-2022-late-may-2022/4029#what-i-think-needs-improvement-5)\n[31.05.2022 - 25.07.2022](https://daotalk.org/t/waynes-worker-proposal-early-june-2022-late-july-2022/4205)\n[26.07.2022 - 25.09.2022](https://daotalk.org/t/wayne-s-worker-proposal-late-july-2022-late-sep-2022/4358)\n\n### Compensation:\nThis compensation proposal is being submitted in accordance with the current [DXdao Worker Guidelines](https://dxdocs.eth.limo/docs/ContributorHub/contributor-onboarding/) and the current [DXdao Pay Structure](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/xdai/proposal/0xd891621300fb5cd46a7962787f4d2fa85998bfb5524aae4b1784a620c562fdae)\n\nExperience Level: 4\n\n**Month one.**\n\n$6,000 (6000xDAI)\n$4,000 (DXD)\n0.1667% (REP)\n\n**Month two.**\n\n$6,000 (6000xDAI)\n$4,000 (DXD)\n0.1667% (REP)\n\n**The full 2 month period.**\n$12,000 (xDAI)\n$8,000 (DXD) to be paid in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff.\n0.3334% (REP) To be claimed at the end of this worker proposal.\n\nMonth one to be paid with the passing of this proposal. \n\n**These services are provided through DevX AG.**\n\nBEGIN KEYBASE SALTPACK SIGNED MESSAGE. kXR7VktZdyH7rvq v5weRa0zkTNDAA9 RYLoFmcXHaJ1rG7 Mux3x6QsApUPNO3 TeGBR1XxFt9UWJu S1q248AbzxpiNNG 067ePShmuT8S6Qc HWNrZf0LwieHkWF wI6WmBQOQG46NIF tBGA5QgGDeeapiV X0NfJ9WrnGNDj3e O8wycuF04ycpY5m 6PWy9JCsN3by8A5 H6x6mvZbBxPuTTL 0miG.

I tried to describe the bugs or strange behavior as well as possible so that the devs could understand and find solution to improve the state\n  - Improving FTC (Test Scenarios, Test Cases and HappyPath) so that they can be ready for automation tests but also for onboarding new members who would pass the manual testing according to the instructions from these documents and get to know better all the possibilities and features of Guilds\n  - Retrospective of the QA work done so far in order to look back on what has been done and consider how we can improve the work done so far and improve the work process even more\n  - Start with automation and working still on LOCAL, plan to push when Smoke test will be ready for the first stage\n\nImproved my understanding of Guilds and changed my approach in some specific cases. Need to work more on application knowledge and going deeply with it.\n\nI understand the values ​​of being a member of a DXdao and remaining self-motivated, disciplined, and consistent in my work. Working at DXdao makes contributors not only better in the technical field or DeFi experts, but also better people who work on themselves in every field and “fight” with themselves to achieve the same goal of decentralization. \n\n**Improvements:**\n\nI was focused on contributing to Guilds as soon as possible and “serving a purpose” as a QA Engineer as much as I can for this trial period I haven’t had that much time to learn and get to know more about DXdao in general and other projects mentioned in the weekly meetings, so my goal is to improve to benefit the community and beyond the Guilds project but to continue to contribute to Guilds as needed and more.\nMore focus on application knowledge, attend more meetings and discussions, work more on QA framework after completion of testing PR’s, better understanding of low level application and communication with smart contracts.\n\n**Proof of work:**\n\n#233 -

I would like to work on it to be able to make more specific validations about my performance and/or take on more responsibilities if my team requires it.\n\nThat said, the scope of my work for this period will remain similar to previous periods: add new features to DAVI and address users feedback, finish work on smart contracts and collaborate with the work started by Madusha of the subgraph and monorepo migration.\n\nIn addition to this, I would like to continue the work we started in the infinite hackathon on off-chain/on-chain mutivote and also to learn a little more about the codebase of other dxdao products.\n\nThere is a gap of days between the end of my last proposal and the beginning of this one (Nov 14-17).

This is the first period where I have dedicated a significant portion of my time to the contracts. At first, I worked on finishing fixes of 1.5 contract issues and refactoring the voting machine. This was previous to the last audit report.\n\nI also worked on the generation of **documentation for the contracts**. This required several updates in the contracts to follow natspect comments format [https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/natspec-format.html](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/natspec-format.html) You can access the new documentation here: **[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/blob/v2.0/docs/SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/blob/v2.0/docs/SUMMARY.md)**. This was done using solidity-docgen package [https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen)\n\nI worked, as part of the **subgraph work**, with the Argentinian team on implementing guilds feature to retrieve guilds information ( name, guildType, proposals, members) from the subgraph.\n\nI spent part of this period working on the new **monorepo architecture**. We needed to integrate all 4 “projects” together (contracts compilation, local node,  subgraph, and davi) to be able to run our local env for davi.  This required fixes/changes in all projects. After being sure that things worked on the monorepo we deprecated subgraph repository and then davi repository to continue working from the new `davi-monorepo` repository [https://github.com/DXgovernance/davi-monorepo](https://github.com/DXgovernance/davi-monorepo). \n\nAs part of the monorepo setup changes that we needed to do on the contracts (mainly due to subgraph requirements), I spend some time familiarizing myself with current deployment scripts and refactoring the **guilds deployment script**. This was the first period that I got into how we do deployments. I made corrections to the guilds deployment scripts and deployed several guilds on xdai. This was very good to have a clear understanding of the current status and start thinking about what we need to do to build a UI around it. \n\nAlthough I couldn't dedicate as much time as I would have liked to continue the development of the \"**multivote**\" functionality for the guilds, I was able to make some progress. Mainly by cleaning up the code, making some fixes to the signature that wasn't working, and adding tests to it. Here is the work in progress **[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/299](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/299)** which I will keep open for feedback. We need to discuss a bit more technical aspects with the dxGov squad to plan how we are going to implement this.\n\nI also did the **DXD token migration** to dxdao-contracts, which is currently under review, the PR can be found here: **[https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/298](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxdao-contracts/pull/298)**. As I previously mentioned in the pull request, this is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that the next stages of the Gov v2 contracts are fully prepared, in line with the guidelines outlined in this proposal ⇒ [https://daotalk.org/t/governance-2-0-final-steps/4782](https://daotalk.org/t/governance-2-0-final-steps/4782)\n\nOverall, this was a productive and enlightening period for me. I was able to acquire a lot of new knowledge and skills, and had the opportunity to apply them by making meaningful contributions to the projects. I feel that I have grown a bit technically during this time, and I am grateful for the experiences that I have had.\n\nAs I mentioned, I faced several challenges during this period and I believe that my specific contributions to Davi new features were not as many as in previous periods. I think this was partly due to the nature of this period, but I will try to not stray so far from that feature development for davi in the next period, if it falls within my scope of responsibilities. On the other hand, I am aware that I focused heavily on the technical side and neglected entirely the governance matters of the DAO. \n\n**Payment:**\n\nSince during this period (since January 1st) payment proposals will be submitted to the guild instead of the DAO, I will adjust my payment proposal to receive the percentage (77%) of days that corresponds to 2022. The rest will be submitted to the guild in another proposal.\n\n- $9240 DAI\n- $6160 DXD vested for 3 years with a 1-year cliff starting 18/11/2022.\n- 5866 REP (0.2545% REP based on the mainnet REP supply of 2305060 at the moment of submitting this payment proposal).\n\n","title":" 8.

This feature is desired to allow multiple parties to contribute to funding a campaign and also to be able to increase the rewards rate of a campaign. One of the original motivations for developing the feature was in thinking about how an Omen Guild would want to experiment with many campaigns and add rewards to successful ones.\n\nThis proposal is to fund an audit of the updated erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts by Team Omega.\n\n**Scope of the Audit**\n\nThe code to be audited will be about 500-600 lines of Solidity code, comprising a contract suite to bootstrap staking campaigns. The code to be audited is on github, here: \n\nhttps://github.com/luzzif/erc20-staking-rewards-distribution-contracts/tree/master/contracts\n\nat commit `ee0605eee011394af82b90f407a9393e17e358fc`\n\nand includes\n`ERC20StakingRewardsDistribution.sol`\n`ERC20StakingRewardsDistributionFactory.sol`\n but excludes\n`StandaloneERC20StakingRewardsDistribution.sol`\n\nThe auditing process includes:\n\n* A thorough inspection of all the code, and the Solidity contracts in particular\n* An analysis of whether the contracts implement the behavior described in the specifications\n\n* Automatic analysis of the contracts using tools such as Slyther and MythX\n* An assessment of the tests and test coverage\n\n* An assessment of how these contracts will be used in a wider context\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nTeam Omega findings will be formalized in a **first report** that includes\n\n* A description of the methods used for the audit\n* An evaluation of the overall quality of the code, including test coverage and documentation\n* A description of any issues we find\n\nAfter the first report is delivered and the developers have addressed any issues that were found, Team Omega will review these fixes and deliver a **final report** in which it is verified that any errors or vulnerabilities previously identified have been properly remediated.\n\nAny additional reviews are subject to newly negotiated terms and pricing.\n\n**Team Omega**\n\nThe audit report will be compiled on the basis of the findings from three auditors.  The auditors work independently.   Each of the auditors has years of experience in developing smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\n**Liability**\n\nThe audit will be on a best-effort basis. In particular, the audit does not represent any guarantee that the software is free of bugs or other issues, nor is it an endorsement by Team Omega of any of the functionality implemented by the software.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe review process will start from the day when the first payment has been received and the code to be audited is provided\n\n* DXdao will deliver the code to be audited no later than November 15\n* The first report will be delivered within 2 weeks of the starting date. \n* DXdao will address any issues within 2 weeks of delivery of the first report\n* The final report will be delivered within 1 weeks after the developers have addressed any issues we may have found\n\n**Cost**\n\nTotal cost is $12,000, half upfront included in this proposal, and the other half due upon completion. In addition to the first payment of $6000, this proposal also included $200 to cover gas costs for transferring funds to mainnet. The main motivation for the proposal being on xDai is to avoid the high cost to DXdao in passing proposals on mainnet.","title":"Audit of Staking Contracts v2","hash":"QmW8TMs21VdUTTzqzNFqitW1vYe52ERErLMKMAQuJge9zx"},"0x6dc55dc62c128e5893771b431dbc8dffd497c08eebcbbf8a18b5192c0b7ebae4":{"description":"Hi, This is Lee ChienHui.

This proposal places an order for 10.44 WETH using a [$3785.27 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) in line with the DXD Buyback Program proposal, which was originally passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45), and extended for another $1m to $3m total, through a further proposal which also passed on [Mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x134c17975ee0e486cdf4719c647c93f94b3bc991b9155193215807521cfce20d) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x56c66f99d87a48d707475aa2466f0a58da13bd744475410957d6572b439cc5bf). The extension on the buyback program was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/extend-dxd-buyback-program-for-another-1m-draft-proposal/3319). \n\nThis proposal would place a limit order on the Gnosis Protocol at a price that is 3% above the time-weighted average price of xDXD/WETH on Swapr when the proposal is executed and the [Oracle contract is called](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xFbAc9467FCcb14394860A9E280E2FBabCBbc8DD2/transactions). The 3% slippage tolerance is under the parameters approved in the [DXD Buyback Program Parameters Update #1](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153) proposal that passed on [mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x58396cc329f5c33bfa29a2e264a05adcad53567a9dcf3e601392d65779dad153) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xd6c4bfd03d87c365432c073ff0f36578c3cba9da080b75de5058357319908039). The order requires 50 WETH in the Swapr xDXD/WETH pool when the oracle checks and has a minimum amount of DXD accepted of 35 DXD. The order is live until Wed Feb 02 2022 16:39:53 GMT.\n\nFurther explanation of the [GP relayer can be found here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdGAjyrpjobow8Hv3fCPoLd5LYRYZPB9qnAWSaRc5krNP). \n\nGiven [the DXD price](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dxdao) and the value of ETH in [DXdao’s treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a), this proposal abides by the DXD Buyback Program, which was passed on [mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) and [xDai](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc122e9ea5460917347538157501f7999d82bdd9b1b8d85bee373391c4b87aa45) and discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-program-signal-proposal/2890).","title":"xDXD Buyback Order #102 for 10.44 WETH","hash":"QmaT37gLNkNdKpS5zCn1tKFmw57ohPf2YRmP5XUFZeGdf8"},"0x726fb5937ed12c0789640e6b3daaa9518338eaa329c5155a96e09e505bac7c41":{"description":"Time Frame: 03/12/2021 - 05/12/2021, 2 months\n\nThis payment request will be for the first half of my compensation from 3.12.21 - 4.12.21. \n\nPosition: Contributor / General Counsel\n\nBackground:\n\nSince my last worker proposal as @pulpmachina, I’ve taken on some different responsibilities in order to address contractor company formation questions that some of our contributors have. In order to fulfill this need, my partner and I decided to separate our positions for DXdao going forward, which is why this proposal is under my new username @tammy. Also, I switched focus to working with @corkus on OMN guild governance parameters, which has been a lot of fun.\n\nProposed Responsibilities and Goals:\n\nOMN Guild project management assistance (non-tech, maybe this is obvious).\nContributor assistance in company formation questions.\nRetention of and coordination with law firm Polsinelli, PC to answer DXdao’s general legal questions. A separate post with more detail on this is coming shortly, and I will provide a link here when posted.\nBuyback transparency documentation with @powers and @fluiddrop\nDXVentures assistance. This is a fun new area for DXdao – a true DAO with an on-chain treasury – to explore how we will format contractual agreements for investments, the goal being to make any agreement as automated as possible. I’m looking forward to how we get to experiment here. Thanks @sky for driving this initiative.\nDXVote assistance in sussing out parameters. @augustol is going to continue work on DXvote now that he has completed some great work on OMN Guild token. I invite others to review and make suggestions for DXVote’s UI and parameters on Github. We’d like to make this project as much as a hive effort as possible.\n“Contributor UX” assistance. This is our new working name for the HR squad. I will support @Melanie @allyq, and @KeenanL ’s efforts to make contributor information and onboarding as clear and scalable as possible.\n\nCompensation:\n\nExperience Level: 5\n\nFor the past two worker proposals (3 months) I was at level 4 compensation. The logic was that my partner and I believed our experience placed us at a level 5, but we first wanted to prove value at Level 4. This work period, I intend to move up to level 5 given my expanding responsibilities and past experience.\n\nFull-time for total of 40 hours per week, for two months (3.12.21 - 5.12.21):\n\n$16,000 (DAI) 50% to be paid once the proposal gets approved and 50% on or after 5/12/2021 when the work agreement finishes.\n\n$12,000 (DXD). $6,000 (DXD) vested at 1 year, and $5,000 (DXD) vested after the first year on a linear schedule.\n\n0.3334% REP\n\nI joined DXdao as a part-time contributor as of 12/12/20. Prior to this, I, along with my partner under @pulpmachina, contributed for two (2) months through DAOtalk topic posts, meeting participation, and Keybase / Telegram discussions. See our list of posts here.\n\nIn case of any change in the compensation guidelines during this work period, the amounts of the compensation in this proposal will be adjusted to match the latest one from the agreed worker compensation guidelines.\n\nExperience:\n\n12/12/20 - 1/12/21 Worker Proposal \n\n1/12/21 - 3/12/21 Worker Proposal\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammy-fisher-7497b130/ ","title":"Tammy Worker Proposal: 3.12.21 - 5.12.21 ","hash":"QmNyLD7XgJrJGVzRsc5iK5J1K4NFG5xDfYtGC316BDWcaK"},"0x727d9839ca308dc5e015d4be457116c5c19431a137d6fe1f89a40be14532f459":{"description":"16.8 Euros is the total paid to Tutanota for the @DXdao.link email service so far, or about 19.5 USD, which I am requesting reimbursement for. \n\n@DXdao.link emails: The @DXdao.link email system uses end to end encrypted email service Tutanota so that any active DXdao contributor who desires to can now have a dedicated work email!

There were many personal highlights and milestones for me during this period. I officially finished working at my “9-5er” and joined DXdao as a full time contributor, cementing my fall DAOn the rabbit hole! This granted me the opportunity to devote all my “thinking” time to DXdao and how I can contribute and add value (while proofreading, I wanted to change devote into DXvote :laughing: - shows how much I have been DXdao’d!)\n\nOn top of all the professional growth, I was given the opportunity to attend ETHAmsterdam which was another milestone in my web3 journey. Definitely on par with finding DXdao for the first time. Meeting the contributors, whom I had only spoken to on calls and heard in meetings, irl was just plain fantastic and will remain with me always!\n\nFrom a personal point of view: the meeting, talking, having dinners and getting to know one another was totally humanizing and heartwarming, and I enjoyed every minute. From a professional point of view, seeing the contributors in action both on and off the stage was awesome! I learnt so much from them about how to interact with other attendees and how to present DXdao. It is difficult to quantify all the subtle lessons here, but in a nutshell, for me the ETHAmsterdam experience was invaluable and unforgettable from both the personal and professional aspect.\n\nWhen I look back and reflect on the past two months I can only be grateful. I am super excited for what the next two months will hold as I further delve into all things DXdao and web3. It is difficult for me to comprehend that it has only been 4.5 months since starting with DXdao.\n\nThank you all once again and as always I welcome any feedback, notes or criticism.\n\nRole:\n\nSocial Media and Community Growth Contributor\n\nTime frame:\n\n2 Month Period - 31.05.2022 - 25.07.2022 (40 hours/week)\nReflection on goals and responsibilities:\nWhat I think I did well in relation to my goals:\n\n1. Improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products and services.\n\nI am happy with the increase of my knowledge in this regard. While I still have lots to learn I no longer feel like I am fumbling around in the dark.\n\n2. Continue clarifying existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities and take them on as my “own”.\n\nIn the past two months I made a point of identifying as many aspects of DXdao’s operations that fall within the community notification framework to ensure that I take “ownership” of these. To make sure the correct information goes out in a timely manner. While there is still work to be done in this area, progress has been good and systems are being created and falling into place.\n\n3. Get to know the remaining key contributors that I have not yet met.\n\nI have gotten to know more contributors and ETHAmsterdam helped a lot with this. I will continue to slowly introduce myself to the community and make contact.\nWhat I think I did well in relation to my Responsibilities:\n\n1. Continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere:\n\nTweets have been coming out in a consistent and timely manner. Quality has been good with an added focus on highlighting the efforts of contributors who represent/ed DXdao in a public manner.\n\n2. Social Engagement:\n\nBetween my activity on Twitter, Medium and at ETHAmsterdam I think that I have been part of the collective that has helped increase the awareness of DXdao and its products. I would also add that while I did this for the public, I picked up a whole lot of knowledge and awareness for myself at the same time.\n\n3. Communications:\n\nI think there has been solid activity and execution on content across Twitter, Medium and Discord.\nWhat I think needs improvement in relation to my Responsibilities\n\n1. Continue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere.\n\nThe Social Highlights program: I have not explored the social highlights program fully. This still needs attention and I will look at allocating time to it during this contributor time frame.\n\n1:10 post to engagement ratio: This happens, but not as consistently as I would like and I need to clarify certain elements of this. This still needs attention and I will look at allocating time to it as well.\n\nWhile I have not addressed these two elements fully up to this point, as my systems of operations fall into place I foresee time freeing up, and organizing these will be on the top of the list to tackle.\n\n2. Social Engagement:\n\n    I still have to analyze competitors, complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on Twitter. I hope to allocate time to this, depending on urgency and priority.\n\n    While I have created content, it has been part of the ongoing events and affairs of DXdao. I have spent some time thinking about where I can add value in developing additional content, but not taken strong actionable steps yet. I will look to nail down a topic and formulate an actionable plan and system during this period.\n\n3. Growth Marketing:\n\nAgain during this period I only briefly looked at metrics at times to see how things were going during certain times. This needs more time and I will be looking at discussing this more with @KeenanL, especially as this aligns with the DXvoice Budget and KPIs.\nSome thoughts:\n\nI realize now more than ever that things move at lightning speed in web3. I get a sense that things are changing in DXdao. With the increase in developer power, upcoming release of guilds, Arbitrum Odyssey, Carrot v1 and two major conferences ahead to name but a few, it is clear that DXdao is shifting into a higher gear. This is going to bring many opportunities and challenges and I aim to do my part in helping the collective deal with the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities.\n\nI think that as I achieve my goals and fulfill my responsibilities I will be able to provide the communication systems DXdao requires to inform the community in a fashion that is both fun and informative.\nGoals:\n\n    Continue to improve my knowledge and understanding of DXdao and its different products and services. (By the look of things, this will become a rolling goal as things change so fast, and there will always be something new to learn).\n    Continue clarifying existing operations/campaigns that fall within my scope of abilities and responsibilities and take them on as my “own”.\n    Get to know contributors that I have not yet met.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nContinue to focus on Twitter and the interaction of DXdao within the Twittersphere.\n\n    The Social Highlights Program: Clarify, update if need be and implement.\n\n    The application of the 1:10 post to engagement ratio: clarify and implement.\n\nSocial Engagement:\n\n    Identify and analyze competitors, complimentary organizations and their communication strategies on Twitter and Discord.\n    Help increase awareness of DXdao and its products, and drive social engagement with the relevant DXdao Twitter accounts.\n    Explore DXdao history and future to assist in developing a content generating strategy to add to mediums deemed acceptable by DXdao.\n\nGrowth Marketing:\n\n    Analyze data and track metrics of tweets to determine what is working and what is not and to optimize tweets according to target audience.\n\nCommunications:\n\n    Assist with ideating and executing campaigns across owned and other media channels as my awareness and knowledge grows.\n\nPrevious proposals:\n\n25.01.2022 - 04.04.2022: 2.5 month Trial period\n05.04.2022 - 30.05.2022\nCompensation:\n\nThis compensation proposal is being submitted in accordance with the current DXdao Worker Guidelines and the current DXdao Pay Structure 1\n\nI have previously stated that I believe my past experience places me within all the levels 1-4, primarily 3 & 4. When starting at DXdao I volunteered to start my contribution at level 3 as a show of good faith, to prove that I have a work ethic in line with that which is expected at DXdao. I have worked the past 4.5 months at that level and after discussion with my squad lead @KeenanL, he agrees that I have delivered on my promises and that I now also more thoroughly fit within the level 4 of the contributor pay structure. So for these reasons and unless there are any objections, I will be moving to the contribution level 4 1 for the foreseeable future.\n\nExperience Level: 4\nMonth one.\n\n    $6,000 (xDAI)\n    $4,000 (DXD)\n    0.1667% (REP)\n\nMonth two.\n\n    $6,000 (xDAI)\n    $4,000 (DXD)\n    0.1667% (REP)\n\nThe full 2 month period.\n\n    $12,000 (xDAI)\n    $8,000 (DXD) to be paid in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff. The vesting contract would be created and funded in the future after 25.07.2022 and use 31.05.2022 as the starting date of the vesting.\n    0.3334% (REP)\n\nThis proposal requests the first month's compensation. REP to be collected along with the second month payment, in the payment request at the end of this contributor period.\n\nBEGIN KEYBASE SALTPACK SIGNED MESSAGE. kXR7VktZdyH7rvq v5weRa0zkZG4Dpb mspHVqgepCOFm4o HjUBdhNGBh7AJ7x p4FCiscYcXz5lcU Gprqa5YjsbQMWDn 0ejYLQcXkmMhvRp HCBNoE4AyY0n1pC XUXwf7PWrYMglAQ dj1Dw5zfCP1h4c5 rPYoGDJrQ3TnbYL Oyf2Ck770i3bTcC oX83oGDhr1G1fMT dWsy.

The extension on the buyback program was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-program-signal-proposal/2890). This funding proposal and the subsequent trade proposal use an updated version of the GP Relayer than the one referenced in the DXD Buyback Program Signal Proposal in order to add Swapr to the GP Relayer’s exchangeFactoryWhitelist.\n\nThe DXD Buyback Program Signal proposal stipulates that the purchase amount should be based on the DXD Average Daily Trading Volume (ADTV). [According to the most recent on-chain data and estimates](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmU1gB6iJbEgxK2BF9ugmH4LSzmwqSA934jb8Y3aieTwtk), DXD has averaged $134k over the last 3 months, so this proposal sends 11.04 WETH to the GP relayer on xDai, identified as `0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46`, using a [$3034.72 ETH/USD price from Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum).

This was discussed on DAOTalk [here](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-dec-21-jan-22/3702). This proposal pays 11,190 xDai.\n\nWhat I did well:\n\n\n\n* [Governance Q1 Update and Roadmap](https://daotalk.org/t/governance-q1-update-and-roadmap/3805) - this was a presentation I gave on a Friday strategy call that gave a general overview of where we’re going. I think it’s best usecase was as a model for others in preparing their annual reviews.\n* Helped @Mel and contributor ux squad [pass new compensation scheme](https://develop.dxvote.dev/#/mainnet/proposal/0xaa3c6d9953d5510a0f014f946e94f03f07a4e5259718e86f07d41d255917e410). I also think I did a good job of providing feedback to others for the contributors reviews as well as the Coordinape notes.\n* DXD Buyback Facilitation along with Fluiddrop. Dave did a great job of managing this through the holidays. I am happy with the consistency of the DXD Trade Volume updates as well as the number of DXD purchases. I also had a forum post in January on [Increasing DXD’s on-chain liquidity](https://daotalk.org/t/increasing-dxds-on-chain-liquidity/3812). This has also been helped by feedback and assistance from DXD holders and the #market-chatter channel\n* Wrote “[DAO Sovereignty](https://governthis.substack.com/p/dao-sovereignty-and-why-its-important?s=r)” for Govern This newsletter. I thought this was a good article that shows what’s unique about DXdao’s governance structure. I also had a great time at the 1Hive Trivia awards and [facilitated the DXD rewards](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-member-balancer-for-1hive-trivia-awards/3830)\n\nWhat I did okay\n\n\n\n* [Expenses](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_A7hiVumUi2eStT-JlcPF-M2OEjiCNdqW9J9_3zU4sk/edit?usp=sharing) - not sure if this should be included in this worker period as I just finished [presenting it last Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKYPg8G2bFY&t=497s), but it’s also why I have not claimed the funds from this worker proposal. I’m happy with the model or system that is now created, but it took way too long. I could have done a better job of including Dave/Ally earlier, but it felt easier to just do it all first myself. We are now working on a more sustainable system.\n* “Reading Period” I did some reading and actually did make major progress on the hardware front (Caney Fork is now a Gnosis Beacon Chain validator!). Still, I felt a little too engaged and think it beneficial to have actual vacation so something distracts your mind.\n* [Helped Sky coordinate efforts](https://daotalk.org/t/discussion-post-proposal-to-increase-dxdao-s-capital-in-swapr-on-gnosis-chain/3786/4) to increase DXdao’s liquidity in Swapr. The funds were transferred but still working through some issues on liquidity provisioning through the relayer.\n\nWhat I did not do okay at\n\n\n\n* Timing. This is late as is my next proposal. The reason is because I try to finish something before submitting the next one. This motivates me to produce but it’s not a great way for everyone to communicate their work load. I should be more realistic in my original worker proposal\n* There were a lot of deliverable goals that were missed. These were mostly governance strategy/coordination efforts around the DXD token and REP syncing. These are important but require community buy-in and it’s tough to move forward with these while other items are more pressing. I still believe these are big long-term problems that need to be addressed and hope to continue to try and push the conversation forward.\n\nPayments and logistics:\n\n\n\n* Total payment in this proposal: $11,190\n* Work period: Dec 1, 2021 - Jan 31, 2021\n* Month 1 (60% work commitment at Level 5 at old compensation structure)\n    * $4,800 xDai\n    * Number of DXD vested for 2 years with 1 year cliff 4.27 (using Coingecko ATH of $844) on 12/1/2021\n* Month 2 (71% commitment at Level 8 in new compensation structure)\n    * $6,390 xDai\n    * Number of DXD vested for 3 years with 1 year cliff 12.89 (using avg DXD price of $523) on 1/1/2022\n* No REP requested as CaneyFork.eth has already reached 4% max on mainnet\n\n\n\nThe scope of work covers the following squads:\n\n\n\n* Governance 50%\n* DXvoice 30%\n* Contributor UX 10%\n* Ecosystem development and security 10%\n\n\n\n## Past Worker proposals\n\n2020\n\n\n\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [July/August]](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-governance-biz-dev-and-content-focused-rep-request/1775)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [August/September]](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-governance-biz-dev-and-community-request-for-worker-compensation/1888)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [October/November]](https://daotalk.org/t/worker-proposal-caney-fork/2152)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [December/January]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-12-1-1-31/2491)\n\n2021\n\n\n\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [February/March]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-feb-march-2021/2661)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [April/May]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-apr-may-2021/2805)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [June/July]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-june-july-2021-draft/2999)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [August/September]](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-aug-sept-2021-draft/3167)\n* [Worker Proposal - Caney Fork [October/November] ](https://daotalk.org/t/caney-fork-worker-proposal-oct-nov-2021/3418)","title":"Caney Fork Proposal & Payout Dec '21 & Jan '22","hash":"QmU1c89ziFQmXLYQbYSdqSckPxU2gx4rPBnW4crNKaBVTs"},"0x753bfb5a08d34e80f87f31fa697f00f991d2e77e54d0509e49feb76539846e0b":{"description":"**Time Frame:** March 1st, 2022 - April 26th, 2022. Full-time with 40 workable days/2 months\n\n**Position:** DXvoice coordinator, Community Leader, Internal Operations and Documentation\n\n**Background:** \n\nThe previous contribution period was busy and rewarding, including the opportunity to shill DXdao like we never have before. ETHdenver was an incredible event and I believe we learned some important things about the market and truly believe our brand has begun cracking the surface of the greater ecosystem. You can get more background on ETHdenver related findings here: https://daotalk.org/t/keenans-ethdenver-thoughts-and-personal-outlook/3933\n\nI moved this proposal ahead a day to account for some reduced time the final week of the previous proposal. This is simply to make accounting easier for both myself and DXdao. I worked partially Feb 24th and 25th, while working fully on Feb 28th (despite not reflected in either proposal).\n\n## Reflection on previous proposal:\n\n### In reflection of my previous proposal, [January - February](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-contributor-proposal-for-01-2022-to-03-2022/3832), what I think I did well includes:\n\n- **Community and Brand** - This period more-so than ever before included branching DXdao into the wider ecosystem. This was accomplished through [interviews](https://twitter.com/KeenanLukeCCC/status/1485712306147258368), [fun trivia games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMNNm65P4IA), impressive ETHdenver merch, and much more. The network effects are becoming apparent, with more and more active crypto participants becoming familiar with DXdao and its vision.\n\n- **Landing pages/DXdocs** - Both the DXdao and Swapr landing pages are now live to high initial praise. The Swapr landing page is notable since its an experiment in combining a traditional landing page dapp separation. DXdocs v1.1.0 also released, and although it still needs lots of work, DXdao's information resource got much, much deeper.\n\n### What I think I could improve on:\n\n- **DXdao Selling/Focal** - I shed some light on this in my ETHdenver outlook post. I think I should focus more time on solidifying what this focal point is, and how we can continue to capitalize on this through objective and monitorable KPI's. More context: https://daotalk.org/t/keenans-ethdenver-thoughts-and-personal-outlook/3933#dxdao-needs-to-discuss-and-clarify-its-focal-selling-point-5\n\n- **Swapr farming organization** - Coordination of the previous SWPR farming epoch became very difficult when considering creation of Carrot campaigns and contentious opinions on use of GNO rewards. Going forward, I'd like to ensure that these campaigns are both live in the UI at least a week before, and created through DXdao governance on Gnosis Chain rather than the multi-chain multi-sig where possible. \n\n## Compensation:\n\nThe previous proposal reflected an adjustment to the updated contributor guidelines. Context can be found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/0xklom-eth-contributor-proposal-for-01-2022-to-03-2022/3832#compensation-6). \n\n* Experience Level: 7\n* Full-time.\n* Month one.\n  * $9,000 (xDai) + $81 (xDai).\n  * $7,500 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n  * 0.1667% REP.\n* Month two.\n  * $9,000 (xDai) + $81 (xDai).\n  * $7,500 (DXD). Vested for 3 years.\n  * 0.1667% REP.\n\n$81 accounts for the previously specified $36 monthly community tool costs (statbot, yagpdb, etc…), as well as $45 monthly expenditure of Discord boosts to attain level 2 (Better audio quality, banner, community server status, etc). Although these community costs are still small, I would like to transition these to either their own proposal or the multi-sig as the costs grow - bonus benefit of deeper accountability and a trail that can be followed if I were to disappear.\n\nThe first proposal will request Month one’s xDai at the beginning of the period. The second proposal will request Month two’s xDai, and 0.3334% mainnet REP on GC at the end of the period. The second proposal will also specify owed % of mainnet REP, and owed DXD based on average price over the final month on Swapr provided it is above $523, otherwise $523 will be used.","title":"0xKLOM.eth Contributor Proposal for 03/2022 to 04/2022 1/2","hash":"Qmc5Dmged9maLNNy2RBjrpcjRgkCmhxNaoV7YetZS2APRn"},"0x7627075c83d3859d2cdb57185c9bdabaea11208f3b6db2f799b86614cbaefde6":{"description":"Further to Chris’ post from June regarding DXLegal Assessments:\n\nhttps://daotalk.org/t/dxlegal-assessments/4304\n\nplease find my report in relation to point 3: AML/KYC overview 4\n\nOn the basis of this paper, I prepared a presentation on this topic which I presented on 23.09.

I mostly worked with Laravel and the Vue ecosystem such as Nuxt and Vuetify. Recently I have been getting more into React as well. I helped build munichNFT 1 which is a platform for local artists to easily mint their artwork and display it. Additionally, I have two apps in the PlayStore and AppStore that I built with Flutter.\n\nI got into crypto at the end of 2017 but that was more for research and investment purposes. Only at the start of this year I started buidling in the Web3 space. Currently, I’m in the 3rd semester of my Master in Data Science.

This proposal is to recap my March & April 2022 contributor proposal.\n\nI estimate my contribution focus to be 55% DXbiz, 10% DXventures, 10% DXvoice, 10% Governance, 15% Other/ContributorX/Product/Testing/Strategy.\n\nIn addition to my focus and responsibilities outlined in my Contributor Proposal, the below list is some of the SkyMine Labs contribution highlights for the Mar’22-Apr’22 period:\n\n- Driving the initiative for DXdao to [sponsor](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-to-sponsor-the-global-governance-gathering-ggg-event-by-the-daoist/3964) The Global Governance Gathering (“GGG”) event by The DAOist in Amsterdam\n\n- Driving the initiative to [produce](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-draft-carrot-awareness-activation-during-eth-week-in-amsterdam-april-18-24-2022/4041) the novel Carrot Awareness Activation During ETH week in Amsterdam\n\n- Developing and leading the KPI-Based Community Incentive Tools [Workshop at GGG22](https://daotalk.org/t/slides-from-skys-kpi-based-community-incentive-tools-workshop-at-ggg22-in-amsterdam/4135)\n\n- Created and led an [impromptu workshop](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNV6kyH6rw1JyDH4HwJEJCv1mAN5qqwGXcdHPRAhwdvQ8) on DAO tooling and the needs of DAOs at GG22. The group discussed lots of ideas - the problems DAOs face today, why and it matters, how the underlying infrastructure also needs to be decentralized.\n\n- Invited to join and participate in a DAO-focused panel alongside a Yearn contributor hosted by Shannon, head community at LivePeer, at the LivePeer Community Summit. The LivePeer community is moving towards DAOifying and was interested to hear about the learnings and practices of DXdao and Yearn.\n\n- Represented DXdao at Gitcoin’s Schelling Point Amsterdam. I was happy to follow Aya Miyaguchi from the Ethereum Foundation and [present on how DAOs can use results-based incentive tokens](https://youtu.be/WneLqBdpFlA). The crowd seemed into the newer concept and a few people asked interesting follow up questions.\n\n- Helping to drive the initiative to integrate COW protocol into Swapr and helping to line up the leveraging of Swapr for the COW token drop and liquidity mining program. Led to the most noteworthy use of Swapr farming since the launch of Swapr.\n\n**Self Evaluation:** The following is a self-evaluation on what I’ve done well, okay, and not well.\n\n* **Did Well:** One of the most valuable things I can do for DXdao is to continue to represent the collective across various communities, high profile events, and public forums to grow awareness of DXdao and connect DXdao to important entities in the space. This is leading to more awareness of DXdao and its products. I think this overall also helps attract new contributors to DXdao.\n* **Did OK:** I think my initiative to take on the role as “main coordinator” of the Carrot Awareness Campaign was important, and allowed it to come to fruition. There were some problems around tight timing, producing assets and implementation, that could have been coordinated better on my part. Next time, we need to start things with more lead time.\n* **Needs Improvement:** Again, I think clearly defining and communicating the actions that other communities can take with regards to DXdao products is still an unanswered task that we have struggled with from a DXbiz perspective.\n\nAs outlined in my kickoff proposal, my commitment percentage for March is 90% so I am adjusting accordingly.\n\n**Proposal Summary:**\n\nSummary of compensation would be:\n\n* 8,100 USD to be paid in xDai (9,000 xDAI x 90% = 8,100)\n* Approval for: 16,150 USD (Mar’22 -> 9,500 x 80% = 7,600 and Apr’22 -> 9,500 x 90% = 8,550) to be paid in DXD in a vesting contract continuously for three years with a one year cliff when the work agreement finishes. The vesting contract would be created and funded in the future after 4/30/2022 and use 03/01/2022 as the starting date of the vesting.\n* Zero REP will be claimed on this contributor proposal (in order to not go over 4% mainnet REP)\n\n**Payout Request in this Proposal:**\n8,100 xDAI","title":"SkyMine Labs - 3/22 to 4/22 Contribution Recap & Payment","hash":"QmeUfAZAbnqjxCzkXSM9fBFMqovQmZv2E9KqqFYUkY577i"},"0x8023328fa77807db1a69ee9afe5e2bd977fea9ea6ddac87b9b242586f219dde8":{"description":"This proposal launches a DXD/WETH farming campaign that starts Thu Oct 28 2021 15:00 and ends Thu Nov 11 2021 15:00 and distributes 11,200 SWPR tokens over that time period.\n\nREP holders approved the SWPR token and farming campaigns through a[ signal proposal that passed in August](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x2d00135332c28271ba27c6f02f9aa79a480b4d7c58df37fb30e6a55353470910).

I’m very grateful to all of you, for being so supportive no matter what. DXdao is genuinely one of the most inspiring and motivating communities to work in. Traditional companies can't hold a candle to a true DAO!\n\nThe DXgov squad continued to focus on Project DAVI during the past few months. We have done large improvements to our codebase and processes and also sent the smart contracts for auditing. A retrospective on the past proposal period can be found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/madusha-contributor-proposal-01-05-2022-30-06-2022/4206/2), which goes into more detail.\n\nIn the current proposal period, the focus will continue to remain on DAVI. We have an upcoming re-audit of the smart contracts and plan to start working on the next milestones in the DXgov roadmap.\n\n### Proposed Scope of Contribution\n\n**1. Goals:**\n\n  * Continue supporting DAVI development and refactoring efforts.\n  * Investigate and fix any bugs encountered during QA testing.\n  * Help implement the social layer of DAVI, powered by Orbis.\n  * Fix any remaining smart contract issues and possibly start working on the next release of DXdao contracts.\n  * Help improve the developer experience and overall code quality.\n\n**2. Responsibilities:**\n\n  * Collaborate with DXgov members to build and improve our governance products.\n  * Keep DXvote development efforts on-track, according to the Attack Plan.\n  * Actively engage in improving the developer experience and ways of working.\n\n### Time commitment\n\n* 80% availability.\n* I will be moving to Europe within this proposal period. I’m reducing my availability to 80% as I expect some impact from travel plans.\n\n### Compensation\n\nExperience Level: 5\n\n* $11200 ($7000 x 0.8 x 2) to be sent half on the first payment proposal, and half on the second payment proposal\n* $8000 DXD ($5000 x 0.8 x 2) vested for three years\n* 0.26672% REP (0.1667 x 0.8 x 2), to be sent half on the first payment proposal, and half on the second payment proposal\n\n### Work Experience\n\n1.

I think we doubled down on the idea of an open organization, the real idea of decentralization, and became exceptionally good at taking criticism and improving ourselves from outside feedback.\n\nThe vision and long term outlook of DXdao is relatively clear and concise. What I do think we are missing the middle layer of social and organizational tools for strategy and efficiency. By nature of the organization being a DAO, there is no direct hierarchy and at times initiatives are pulled in different directions, which is not always bad! However, I do think we need to polish our mid term strategy, define and formalize leadership pockets, and set goals and objectives for the mid term. My bias leans towards yearly DXdao OK-Rs and quarterly squad OKRs (with incentives!) but I’m open for other frameworks and suggestions.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XmHrOrS.png)\n\n","title":"GreaterThan Workshop in DXretreat","hash":"QmYU7yK43QffdRKu1dorcubV5MBc8FQiR33yguer4dxy2G"},"0x876c18569af33d71ec1942b7ac49d3d833a892fb4a798df6339a20a05fe5f791":{"description":"This proposal is a test transaction to see if we can exchange ERC20 tokens directly on curve through a generic multicall scheme.\n\nThis proposals authorizes the 3pool on curve to withdraw 10wxDai from DXdao treasury\n","title":"Test proposal to swap 10 wxDai to USDC on Curve 3Pool [Authorize 3Pool 10 wxDai]","hash":"QmSynGcaxTK4StJ1aqsoMMdinsGGj8dpfwfHy7NZb5vMiY"},"0x877975e75677e13e6c8ab8e43e8dcc5047bf692db39f7c2e1b4c1fb1cdc0779f":{"description":"\n    \nThis proposal places a 7 WETH order on CowSwap for DXD.

I work as a QA Engineer most of the time. I have 3+ years of experience in automation and manual testing. I’m familiar with the role called Lead QA Engineer and Tech Team Lead, but also with the PM role, I said “called” because I don’t want to speak about roles I want to speak about responsibility. Most of my time worked on systems that contain one of the blockchain components, the Crypto projects that I work on are Filecoin (Protocol Labs), Cardano (IOHK), and SLE.\nI am very passionate about Web 3.0 and Decentralized systems, because IMO the real world that has only Blockchain (where we speak about immutability and transparency) is not full-scaled without DeX, DeFi and other awesome technologies that are decentralized. I started as a QA Engineer in the DXgov Guilds team in the middle of May.

It concludes that 1) general partnership risks are less of a concern for DXdao compared to other US DAOs due to its lack of critical mass in one single US state and the risks can be further mitigated by DXdao’s global decentralization strategy and governance agreement regarding dispute settlements; 2) the risk of token offerings being viewed as security is low as the tokens are most likely to be viewed as utility tokens; 3) DXdao will be further exposed to US taxation risks once its product/services become more profitable given its close link with the US key contributors.\n\nIn view of the type and magnitude of risks at hand, it proposes two sets of actionable recommendations depending on the resources and priorities of DXdao:\n\nMinimal steps:\nDXlegal shall implement continuous risk monitoring and assessment with contributor squad & governance and treasury, especially in the following areas:\nContributor residence\nproduct/business map: identify which products/squads are most at US legal/taxation risks\nTreasury: pay particular attention to activities that can be tied to the US.\nLong-term talent strategy and governance:\ni.

Under the static/current law approach, it requires a multi-pronged approach that combines decentralized jurisdictions with decentralized entities/ purpose/products. Under the progressive approach, where law is a viewed as a construct and evolves to adapt the needs of society, DAOs can be recognized under the private international law, which will be aligned with DXdao’s ultimate vision as self-sovereign.\n\n3.I’ve also presented my findings at the Business Strategy call, you can find the presentation deck here:\nhttps://www.notion.so/Presentation-on-DXdao-s-US-Legal-Challenges-and-Global-Decentralization-Strategy-bc90b5810d4546dd81656a779e1d5fac\n\nPlease don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or want to discuss further.

Firstly, I would like to highlight my work on the Swapr Ad banner. When I first started working on the Swapr Ad banner I could just make it into animated gif, but that’s not very optimal because the file size limit is 300kb only. Gif banners usually have low image quality to save on file size. Decided to go with html5 animation for better quality, so I learned how to create animation in html5 and was very happy with the results. Next, when the holiday season started, it was a good opportunity to propose a little initiative - festive social media profile pictures for DXdao, Swapr and Carrot. Really glad that the idea was warmly received, more so it even followed by turning the designs into POAPs. Still wanted to add a little twist to them. I’ve seen a few animated POAPs, but I didn’t know how they were made. Did a little research and learned a new technique to apply it into holiday POAPs. Yes, those are relatively small initiatives, but as a designer I consider them as a nice start.\n\nHere is a list of projects I was engaged in:\n\n- DXgov social media/medium banners\n- Swapr social media/medium banners\n- DXdao social media/medium banners\n- Carrot POAP design\n- Holiday social media images\n- Holiday POAP design\n- Swapr Ad banner\n","title":"Borisblock — Contributor Proposal [07/11/21 - 07/01/22] 2/2","hash":"Qmb5TriuoVQcUKwZAfjuxPLXsdSFkvdHNspshYfgeUWQZF"},"0x8ec7d23b51bc4479adf1d27967236f57277eca61cf7e59d5c36c0b21a75226ac":{"description":"Proposal to remove DaoDeployer 0x50d895Df2ea26b4C3aBbFa22906197458F56bAe9\n\nThis proposal is created following a schemes cleaning operation discussed in the daotalk forum on the topic https://daotalk.org/t/remove-old-schemes-mainnet-gnosischain/4209","title":"Remove DaoDeployer 0x50d895Df2ea26b4C3aBbFa22906197458F56bAe9","hash":"QmTNYBAwHbp5djWz4e6nwPHym5sHgnepUoxGLroaJtroep"},"0x90066502ca081fc0b2f99b749a36fd66c883cbee36574e66d3135d864f16186f":{"description":"**Time Frame:** January 3rd, 2022 - February 27th, 2022.

After discussion with relevant contributors and considering my reviews from the new review program, I will be posting this proposal at level 7. My responsibility pool including leadership tasks, to me, fairly put me within the bounds of level 7. Although personally, I would consider myself freshly within this level, and I believe I still have lots of room for personal growth and time before considering any further adjustments. This comes on the tail end of 0xKLOM.eth transitioning to level 5 on the original compensation guidelines. \n\n* Experience Level: 7\n* Full-time.\n* Month one.\n  * $9,000 (xDai) + $81 (xDai).\n  * $7,500 (DXD).

Vested for 3 years.\n  * 0.1667% REP.\n\n$81 accounts for the previously specified $36 monthly community tool costs (statbot, yagpdb, etc…), as well as $45 monthly expenditure of Discord boosts to attain level 2 (Better audio quality, banner, community server status, etc). Although these community costs are still small, I would like to transition these to either their own proposal or the multi-sig as the costs grow - bonus benefit of deeper accountability and a trail that can be followed if I were to disappear. \n\n**This proposal will request Month one’s xDai at the beginning of the period.** The second proposal will request Month two’s xDai, and 0.3334% mainnet REP on GC at the end of the period. The second proposal will also specify owed % of mainnet REP, and owed DXD based on average price over the final month on Swapr provided it is above $523, otherwise $523 will be used.","title":"0xKLOM.eth Contributor Proposal for 01/2022 to 03/2022 1/2","hash":"QmWf3sx6odX8ANU55LF1nFsP48vTsBjFCacP7oUXhdSJJ1"},"0x9068730f250cf02238b5db3311a54b2f42a9e237eb95632efe8ad1ba03895654":{"description":"\n    \nThis proposal places a 4 WETH order on CowSwap for DXD.

Below is a recap of the contributions along with links to a Master Service Agreement and Scope of Work that govern the relationship going forward. These are written as contractual agreements between DXdao and Space Inch. Passage of this proposal is a “signature” from DXdao to those agreements.\n\nTimeframe\n\nNovember 1 - 30, 2022\n\nResponsibilities\n\nOskar (karczuRf):\nOskar in November has been focusing mainly on two big features: upgrade wallet library and LP-Zapping.\n\nThe first one was about integrating the newest version of web3-react library to fix plenty of bugs and improve user experience while using Swapr. The task is completed, so the code was reviewd and checked with approvals. Currently is ready to be merged. The PR can be found on Swapr-dapp github repo: feature/upgrade-wallet-library by karczuRF · Pull Request #1330 · levelkdev/swapr-dapp · GitHub.\n\nThe second task LP-Zapping is brand new feature in Swapr. It allows to swap any token for 2 different tokens and add liquidity to the pool with just 1-click. It works also in another direction, so allows to remove liquidity from the pool and swap pool’s tokens to any different token, obviously also with 1-click. It is worth mentioning that zap feature is innovative as allows to use any DEX supported by Swapr, so with EcoRouter zapping is cost optimized and flexible. It is also prepared to use it with new DEXs if needed. To achieve it Oskar by himself has written brand new Zap smart contract (with test) and deployed it on Goerli testnet and Gnosis network. Also he fully adjusted Swapr frontend to use Zap contract, so dedicated designs and user-flow components were added. Currently Zap feature is waiting to be tested by QA and reviewed.

I have already completed my 2 week trial at DXdao,  and this proposal will outline the first two months of my contributions as a Solidity Developer.  For the moment, I will be contributing primarily to Omen. \nI have been in contact with @JohnKelleher and @AugustoL at DXDao in regards to filling this role.\n\n**Timeframe:**\n- 4/15/2021 - 6/15/2021\n- My 2 week trial period was completed from 4/2/21 - 4/15/21.  Details of my trial period and proposal can be found [here](https://daotalk.org/t/chris-pearson-lnlhb-com-developer-proposal/2813).\n\n**Proposed Scope of Contribution:**\n- Security review of Omen guild contracts \n- Read several proposals, about DAOStack, DXDao, Omen, Governance 2.0, AMM, Reality.io, Gnosis, Holographic Consensus, DXDao participation agreement, Contributor Hub, Contributor Guidelines, Hardhat, the Buyback program, DXDao Manifesto, US tax implications of this, \n- Try to understand Omen scalar markets\n- Set up necessary accounts to route XDAI to more widely accepted currency\n- Attend daily meetings\n- Buy some DXD\n- Learn how the ERC20Guild contract works (so in part how DXDGuild works)\n- Work with Kaden and Augusto on OMNGuild smart contract testing and development\n- - https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/commit/a40235b6f90873bc8904bc524abbe1a81a39e63f\n- - https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/commit/3f04d9dd1470d3fa3a78c32026e9d9a806ae7c3a\n- - https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/pull/1/commits\n- - https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/pull/4/commits\n- - https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/pull/7/commits\n- Write tests for @KadenZipfel's staking contracts\n- Work with @martinkrung on Mesa smart contracts.\n- Pre-audit contracts before being sent for final audits ( check off this list https://blog.sigmaprime.io/solidity-security.html  and try to exploit) \n \n \n**Self Reflection on Trial:**\n    My first few weeks of contributing to DXdao was challenging, yet rewarding.  I believe I did well at getting up to speed at learning most aspects of Omen and DXdao, and was able to start contributing to the test writing for the Omen guild promptly alongside Augusto.  However, I need to more proactively seek out deliverables  and assistance by asking more established members what they need help with or what they can help with, as there is no end to information in this ecosystem that could consume my attention if not tied to deliverables.\n\n**Compensation:**\n- Experience Level: 5\n- Time commitment: Full-time\n- [12800 DAI] : For 2 months of work at level 5, to be sent half on the first payment proposal and half on the second payment proposal(at 80%)\n- [18.36 DXD] : Vested for 2 years with a 1 year cliff starting the (at 80%)\n- [4121.6 REP]: For 2 months of work, to be sent half on the first payment proposal and half on the second payment proposal( 0.1667% REP at 80%)  \n\n**Work Experience:**\n- Worker Trial Proposal 4/2/21 - 4/15/21\n- Trial period work for DXdao\n- - OmenGuild tests https://github.com/AugustoL/dxdao-contracts/commit/a40235b6f90873bc8904bc524abbe1a81a39e63f\n- My most recent resume can be found [here](http://azai.net/resume/)\n","title":"LNLHB.com Worker Proposal 4/15/2021- 6/15/2021","hash":"QmQYdAptuQL7igvci942SzYdfe1jp2TcQA4eAYmtaZb52S"},"0x931d205d03b1cc7635ee21f77b979d6896187d76f30963005b86d96720d57f48":{"description":"In accordance with [this proposal from mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x26605ac44027de3d2e03f3168040ce45ed9706970fef0fec2ad8db0e870bdbba), this proposal will order a liquidity deposit in Swapr for 52,560 USDC and 52,560 XDAI, which would be sent to the relayer by [this xDXdao proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0x50e4e7ea69ff9922ba1616c75cbec80e60897ff4f79beac97240f01d6f64e3b5).","title":"Provide Liquidity on Swapr USDC/xDAI pair via Swapr Relayer I","hash":"QmefHfvz2z746rEZjzDMjJmfEdCe7o5375RkEjHiB6KjhX"},"0x952d8b39ff8dd5f0620dbe426acb3d137d92819cbb0631c6f9de734ac1a93c9f":{"description":"This proposal updates the swap fee for the LP SWPR / XDAI to 1% ","title":"[SWPR / XDAI] - Swap fee update to 1%","hash":"QmU5CktrfALTA6fX49nieyZWoGpSzmyaBkR4ygwoqMNwwL"},"0x9576582f2d4ccc1fa3fb25fa08cf5cc7d087c84dfcad5af26839fbf76295b571":{"description":"This proposal aims to reimburse Keenan Luke for purchase of the DXdocs.eth domain and associated gas costs. xDXdao provides an avenue for these smaller reimbursements, go xDai!\n\nDXdocs.eth registration cost: 0.01279ETH (28.03 xdai)\n\nRegistration gas: 0.008ETH (17.53 xdai)\n\nSet content hash, remove eth address, set controller, send registration, contrib rew: 0.0133ETH (29.15 xdai)\n\nTotal est: 74.71 xDai\n\n\nRelevant transactions:\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x136d6df7bf0fdb61a097c03ded8f00858ee78907a7e8e93980b16057df8fefd6\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x2f502dee59595186267afef616278a0ea1f7f0d7ce66e64d0055162ec2b02679\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xd087ccaaecaf90ffed98dbe6d7bf3be1556eb74e45a10f887986c0323db35e06\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xd6e5c050cf9912ae98130c37b416fa9b2744246e257966e3e5a3f6ba32c0ab2b\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x48a9e7eebc2a0cd6c7fee3d9df2f9677a33aa1dc608a70e783d07996eb3f39c8\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xb882169a2c8fc09f73f14a758ec71a5371e2a4a1c7f6e6cb6dd18f55c5fa167f\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x7b383242866dab0f6e7f799541dfa8ec2b6f85e3b18551365d6be8486a9cb83f\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x998be83b8855963711f38c03d6f6cd0445bf1b607b55ef2e1df772c235ba4aeb","title":"DXdocs Domain Registration Reimbursement","hash":"QmWyS538MUkHx2fpch3LKVRs6hV19GgKEamtxtKe5GrXQ3"},"0x962e98edf8534021eff005db3953b887e2a310faa82d8c7cab7403cda0167e86":{"description":"TEST ALCHEMY RPC / SUBGRAPH","title":"TEST","hash":"QmcPcvhffaiD9ce7MbN2p3qiMqo9uqGCmhGRPpxZhyFT6V"},"0x964a8ab667f4d41e9436533f86df11bf065287ada640dd80f1bf547fb0154372":{"description":"This is second part of [this worker proposal ](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xc7d58c37c58f7ec8557e8f6c78bf84afdc9eb14f5ec868e63acf161d9662fc9f)\n\nProof of work:\n- Storybook researched and implemented with tons of cools features like automatic chromatic deployment with permalinks, mdx storybook format and refactored buttons folder https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/pull/1129\n- Also as you can see from issues and if you were around the refactoring calls I deeply researched our codebase and latest react deisgn patterns and was part of the discussion and setting up one call related to refactoring https://github.com/levelkdev/swapr-dapp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AUX%2FDX","title":"Violet Worker Proposal 31/05/2022-31/07/2022 2/2","hash":"QmTSxsErr1j8Q4DcQAJFRpb2nhuTyxoZqrgUQBisZHRNHB"},"0x971bb957d01a52d68ac8d4a4ccf3e7fd0583e4528a665cfb6e99fa641da844c3":{"description":"This proposal launches a AGVE / XDAI farming campaign that starts Thu Mar 17th 2022 at 15:00 and ends Thu Apr 14th 2022 at 15:00;

With another ~8.5k ETH still idle within the treasury, it is important for the DAO to consider investing these assets. Liquid ETH staking remains an optimal solution, providing ~4.5% returns with minimal risk vs other solutions, such as Aave, providing only ~0.4% APY.\n\nThere are early signs that the ETH staking network is getting congested, with validator queues reaching up to 3 weeks recently. As the demand for staking increases in the run-up to, and after the Merge, network congestion could increase further. It is an optimal time for DXdao to get ahead of the market and deploy further funds into ETH staking.\n\nWhilst diversifying across staking providers is important, this proposal will focus on adding further ETH only to the StakeWise pool. Lido’s TVL has grown significantly since the first staking proposal and there are growing concerns about their size and the amount of leveraged ETH staked within their pool. On the other hand, Rocket Pool are having issues scaling given their current infrastructure model, with their staking pool frequently closed to any new deposits.\n\nStakeWise has recently launched liquid staking on Gnosis chain and is currently the only liquid staking provider on the network. This provides DXdao with an opportunity to put further treasury assets to work in a liquid fashion.\n\nAs a reminder, StakeWise uses a dual token model - paying rewards in a separate token, rETH2 (rGNO), mapped to ETH (GNO) earned in the Beacon Chain. sETH2 (sGNO) represents the initial ETH (GNO) deposit into the staking pool and acts as an interest-bearing wrapped ETH (GNO). StakeWise has deep liquidity for both sETH2, rETH2 and sGNO, allowing DXdao to un-stake, with minimum slippage, should the need arise.\n\n|     | **Gnosis** |\n|:------------:|:------------:|\n|     **Token**    |     sGNO    |\n|      **APY**     |       17.5%   |\n|     **Fees **    |       10%    |\n| **Total Staked** |        ~40k    |\n\n### Proposal\nDeploy 255 GNO to StakeWise. DXdao will rely upon the Multi-Sig 0x9467dcFD4519287e3878C018c02f5670465a9003, which has already handled previous ETH staking proposals. Once the sGNO tokens are acquired, the MS shall return those funds to the mainnet DXdao treasury.\n\n### Acquiring the staked assets\nStake natively via the [StakeWise UI](https://app.stakewise.io/).\n\n### More info\n[Website](https://stakewise.io) / \n[Docs](https://docs.stakewise.io/)\n","title":"Stake 255 GNO - Signal Proposal","hash":"QmTLPCTi58PebFkJpAWyW1njsDifNDMPFLB8sPTMQyFsSX"},"0x99ad0a5a48421ae7399c961f082d55c5bd2650c25f790e1c336d77bb6368f084":{"description":"This proposal launches a CRV / XDAI farming campaign that starts Thu Dec 9th 2021 at 15:00 and ends Thu Dec 23rd 2021 at 15:00; distributing 1,680 SWPR tokens over that time period.\n\nREP holders approved the SWPR token and farming campaigns through a[ signal proposal that passed in August](https://dxvote.eth.link/#/mainnet/proposal/0x2d00135332c28271ba27c6f02f9aa79a480b4d7c58df37fb30e6a55353470910).

Working at DXdao makes contributors not only better in the technical field or DeFi experts, but also better people who work on themselves in every field and “fight” with themselves to achieve the same goal of decentralization. \n\n**Improvements:**\n\nI was focused on contributing to Guilds as soon as possible and “serving a purpose” as a QA Engineer as much as I can for this trial period I haven’t had that much time to learn and get to know more about DXdao in general and other projects mentioned in the weekly meetings, so my goal is to improve to benefit the community and beyond the Guilds project but to continue to contribute to Guilds as needed and more.\nMore focus on application knowledge, attend more meetings and discussions, work more on QA framework after completion of testing PR’s, better understanding of low level application and communication with smart contracts.\n\n**Proof of work:**\n\n#233 -

The new structure is meant to ensure long-term contributor alignment with DXdao and remain competitive with market salary rates. Once this proposal passes, contributors to DXdao can reference it for compensation in proposals starting from the date of proposal passage (UTC time).\n\nThe new proposed contributor level guide and compensation can be found on ipfs [here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPpkUZnvyXg9KWEMR6BoLT398CThoBD8B995z4kZ8X2VB), as well as in the chart below.\n\n**DXD compensation**\n\nContributors should use the current DXD price at the time of proposal submission. All DXD compensation should be vested linearly over 3 years with a one year cliff. Governance can implement more specific processes to calculate the current price and ensure that proposal submission times are not gamed. To account for the price volatility for crypto assets and protect the treasury in unforeseen events, DXD compensation has a floor price of which the DXD price shall be calculated. The initial floor price should be set at $225. This ensures a maximum annual 3.37% release of current treasury DXD figures, compoundable over three years.\n\nDXdao on-chain governance may adjust this number at any time as it sees necessary.\n\n**Determining compensation levels**\n\nCurrent and future contributors should closely assess the language presented in the compensation structure descriptions and have a discussion with their squad leader or other relevant contributors to their vertical.\n\nContributors are encouraged to meet with at least two (2) other contributors to discuss the new compensation level. Previous Level 5 contributors and squad leader should meet with at least two (2) other squad leaders to discuss what level you would fall under in the new Compensation Structure. @melaniedavis and the Contributor UX squad can also provide support.\n\nContributors should make an educated decision surrounding their compensation level based on the updated level descriptions and any feedback received. If a contributor doesn’t feel a level completely describes them, they should start at a lower level. Although there is no direct conversion, generally speaking contributors are likely to fall within the following levels:\n\n\n**Current Level \tNew level to consider**\n\nLevel 1 \t    Level 1-3\n\nLevel 2 \t    Level 2-4\n\nLevel 3 \t    Level 3-5\n\nLevel 4 \t    Level 5-7\n\nLevel 5 \t    Level 6-8\n\nFuture contributors are encouraged to read the level descriptions and consult with their squad leader and the Contributor UX squad to determine an appropriate level.\n\nUltimately, DXdao’s on-chain governance has the final say.\n\n**Promotions**\n\nLike all worker engagements, promotions are led by the individual contributor, who can apply in a new worker proposal to be at a higher level. The community will provide feedback on the worker scope in the forum and squad leads are encouraged to vocalize when a contributor in their squad has misrepresented their level, be it to the low or high end. REP holders will use various signals from the community and collective to determine whether or not to approve the “promotion” to a higher level.\n\n**Product tokens**\n\nProduct tokens will be left up to product squads, but if a DXdao contributor is focused on a specific product, then a portion of that contributor’s DXD compensation may be substituted with the specific product token.\n\n**Additional FAQ and forum post can be found** [here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-compensation-structure-overhaul-june-2021-draft-proposal/3066) ","title":"DXdao Compensation Structure Overhaul - 2021","hash":"QmUaakp5EkSy7brY3JJ5oH5MgJCeYq5JdzJguYopPtxtr7"},"0xbac4a7a427401f42f08b69770d2e30f980a91142598cd752b889b7bb020054c4":{"description":"As per the worker proposal I'm asking to be compensated for period November and December 2021.\nFor full recap [forum discussion thread](https://daotalk.org/t/zett-proposal-oct-nov-dec-2021-ft-product-owner-ui-ux/3683/4).\n\n## Recap\n\n### [](https://daotalk.org/t/zett-proposal-oct-nov-dec-2021-ft-product-owner-ui-ux/3683/2#period-2-november-2)Period  #2  November\n\nHighlights of this period was releasing the long waited Bridge MVP that included the Arbitrum native ETH bridging and integrating Carrot into Swapr and running campaigns on xdai.\n\nDuring this period we released 3 versions of Swapr which includes:\n\n## [](https://daotalk.org/t/zett-proposal-oct-nov-dec-2021-ft-product-owner-ui-ux/3683/2#beta-7httpsgithubcomlevelkdevdxswap-dappreleasestagv100-beta7-3)[Beta 7](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.7)\n\n### [](https://daotalk.org/t/zett-proposal-oct-nov-dec-2021-ft-product-owner-ui-ux/3683/2#features-4)Features\n\n-   ETH bridge implementation from mainnet to Arbitrum  \n    ![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/daostack/original/2X/1/16abc1cbca8025f3cdfe34e2ae481205c88274d4.png)\n    \n-   Voting and governance through Snapshot\n\n## [Beta 8](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.8)\n\n### [](https://daotalk.org/t/zett-proposal-oct-nov-dec-2021-ft-product-owner-ui-ux/3683/4#features-6)Features\n\n-   Carrot KPI tokens integration  \n    ![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/daostack/original/2X/f/fbf324235c09d48f2163ff9d2acfa8f1507fd86b.png)\n    \n-   New and simplified farming campaigns list\n    \n-   Various Bug fixes\n    \n\n## [](https://daotalk.org/t/zett-proposal-oct-nov-dec-2021-ft-product-owner-ui-ux/3683/4#beta-81httpsgithubcomlevelkdevdxswap-dappreleasestagv100-beta81-7)[Beta 8.1](https://github.com/levelkdev/dxswap-dapp/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.8.1)\n\n-   Various Bug fixes\n\nDuring this period I worked on the design of new and improved Pairs and rewards ui/ux which separates those.

After passing that 2-week trial period, this proposal will include the next 2 months of work (trial period). \nThe last 2-week period has been great. I was able to make progress on the goals I had set for myself and I think I was able to contribute to the team. Sure this will be a work in progress for several months, but technically and conceptually I feel much more comfortable working with on-chain architecture, web3, contracts interaction, etc. I also think that I have become more familiar with how the dxvote dapp works since I had the opportunity to work on things not so superficial like the cache, different services and stores. Even though it was tough at first, it was really good to speed up my part-time onboarding. For this proposal I will focus on continuing to collaborate with the dxgov team, contributing to the guilds MVP, and supporting dxvote. \n\n**Timeframe:** \n\n2 months starting December 13, 2021, to February 6, 2022. 20 hours per week (part-time) \n\n**Goals:** \n\n- Collaborate with the DXGov team on the DXVote project. \n\n- Gain more understanding about Guild and support MVP development \n- Work on any issue(s) and/or feature(s) that the team leader sees fit for me. \n\n- Familiarize myself with the code (Like app architecture, libraries, components structure, logic layer, cache , contracts integration) and also with deployment process, team meetings and methodology. \n\n- Learn more about Blockchain and web3 development in general and also how DXDAO operates. \n\n- Catch up with the worker proposal flow \n\n**Responsibilities:** \n\nCollaborate with the dxgov team to build Guilds MVP and support dxvote \n\n**Compensation**\n\n**Experience Level:** \n\nFor work completed from November 29 to December 31, level 3 of the previous structure.

If the proposal passes, this [announcement](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRDwuJ8HovZbEW7y9iQeqM5GT7dciCVnRYPCsX2LKqBAA) can be referenced with all relevant details. This was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-program-signal-proposal/2890). This is the [corresponding mainnet proposal](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8). *\n\n### Background\n\nREP holders launched DXD last year through a [bonding curve smart contract](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa). In this design, only product revenue drives DXD value accrual; DXD holders do not directly benefit from a rise in the value of DXdao’s treasury. This will change in the upcoming [Governance 2.0 design](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0xf57b8345b7bcafdff729e2441900b5340251bcc83a4a4c48c6b273eed7ecb717), but the recent appreciation of ETH in the treasury has distorted the relationship between the economic value of DXdao and DXD.\n\nSimultaneously, the long-term prospects of DXD and DXdao are strong, with a well-funded treasury and an emerging, diversified product suite. DXdao is set to launch an OMN token with Omen Guild governance capabilities, Swapr is rolling out on multiple chains and Mesa prepares for a v2 relaunch. DXD is positioned to rise in value over the coming years as these products and DXdao’s assets generate cash flow.\n\nThe community has debated [the prospects of a DXD buyback](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-program-signal-proposal/2826) for several months on calls, Keybase/Discord and in [the forum](https://daotalk.org/t/dxd-buyback-using-eth-from-the-treasury/2503). The community has reached soft consensus to move forward with the buyback program as a way to acquire an undervalued asset and reward DXD holders for the rise in the value of the treasury. This process can be carried out on Mainnet or xDai. In the future, DXdao may use a different relayer and on-chain method to complete the purchase. \n\n### Details\n\nThe community has been working to enact the buyback program in a decentralized and transparent manner. Voting FOR this proposal signals support for the creation of the DXD buyback program as outlined below and in the supporting documents.\n\nThis [announcement](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRDwuJ8HovZbEW7y9iQeqM5GT7dciCVnRYPCsX2LKqBAA) lays out the conditions of the program. To briefly summarize, DXdao is committed to purchasing up to $1m of DXD on the open market as long as the book value of the ETH and stablecoins in the [treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a) is larger than DXD’s outstanding circulating supply. These trades will be executed at a price that is 2.5% above DXD/ETH TWAP price at time of execution and will not exceed 25% of average trading volume.\n\nTrades will use a Gnosis Protocol Relayer Contract (“GP Relayer”) deployed by the community to complete the trades. Each trade requires two proposals. One to send the ETH funds to the GP Relayer, and then a second proposal to set the order using the funds in the relayer at the price determined by the specified oracle. This [technical explainer](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmdc477sHnuBomCHGLp4aBxABTTBkgJrCTZs95ceZvEmpd) goes into greater detail on how the GP Relayer works.\n\n### Risks and Other Considerations\n\nThis is the first time that DXdao is considering purchasing DXD on the open market. It’s also the first time DXdao has used the GP Relayer on Mainnet. It has been [audited](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdCvSMRkKWxJmdLZVu7REJa67LGFoPchuMeUYVMNYosn6) and tested on xDai. There are additional risks given that this is a market trade that relies on an on-chain action.\n\nThis buyback program represents new ground for DAOs and DXdao intends to be as transparent as possible. The following documents have been created to provide additional information and context:\n\n* [DXD Buyback Announcement](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRDwuJ8HovZbEW7y9iQeqM5GT7dciCVnRYPCsX2LKqBAA)\n* [DXdao Q1 Financial Statements](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmemjpvoCh3FDF5E3g6s3gzBkXokjMiq71a6LvHaCVYXrc)\n* [Buyback Technical Explainer](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmdc477sHnuBomCHGLp4aBxABTTBkgJrCTZs95ceZvEmpd)\n* [DXdao Governance Structure Overview](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRi9BYALqeGnxg5sWZXRwZHm95gWyoB1ENqjzg3YdwM47)\n* [DXD Buyback Risk Factors](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUxvBCgv6nCq2BdKJTKsSbX7hQ6jAixqCBrpgW1QiZ8Lv)\n* [DXD Average Daily Trading Volume](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVhetA1xS6k8LTXnn8FWH5PRXhV3Qy4Q5ZoJSvokx3A6q)\n\n\n*Disclosure: I (Caney Fork) hold DXD*","title":"DXD Buyback Program [Signal Proposal]","hash":"QmWKcDfyTZeN8KfNq7vA7NLYB1smTwZbmwSXYb1Hk4jsW6"},"0xc135383202387313dff504a0c97b09bf3690594ce19b1daaeeeba8553ea5e189":{"description":"This proposal provides liquidity to Swapr on the WETH-WXDAI pair, provisioning 108.5 WETH and 357,860 WXDAI as outlined in this DAOtalk post: https://daotalk.org/t/transfer-400-eth-to-xdxdao-for-swapr-deposits-and-xdxdao-operations/3149\n\n\nThis mainnet proposal:\nhttps://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x7382e5b42ee13842cf13d1cabc7d8b0c7ab09aff3c56f3b3f29756716741aef4\n\nAnd this preceding liquidity relayer funding proposals :\nhttps://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/proposal/0xa7d2de3bb0911e2d996e2fcccaa0b7aba493b529e325f709003ad1f884343b2c","title":"Provision Liquidity on WETH-WXDAI pair in Swapr","hash":"QmRhY3vKgcPm2Q2NUnhZ6d7f87icJnT4C56BPmYgiWz14T"},"0xc1d7f05df858c11c0d361f25b820aac46e97ac975c293a13590e5846f3d6eba0":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

The primary changes include level qualification changes, and the reduction to REP distribution as a result. You can find the previous signal proposal [here](https://dxvote-dev.netlify.app/#/xdai/proposal/0x306a8623c1f0a2ba3d9cf5659628bc6bc68a11c85db60f50424219db6e5fead3). Here is a brief overview of the post:\n\n> ## Background\nWelcome to Q3! Since Q1 of 2021, I’ve organized a quarterly REP boost that targets community activity and retention. After a successful 1st, and of course 2nd period, we are back once again for a third Discord REP boost. This will need to pass through governance, since there have been some additional Discord role changes that alter the effectiveness/attainability of each level. This largely includes the removal of level 1, and reductions to the lower and upper bounds. Here is some context from the original proposal:\n\n>```With the introduction of the DXdao Discord server, @KeenanLuke has proposed an initiative to get more community members involved in Governance. A governance gateway drug, if you will. This functions as a quarterly allocation; a way for us to leave the door open to those most active in the community to further involvement with DXdao and its governance.```\n\n>In its current configuration, the DXdao Discord server tracks a user’s participation in the preceding quarter and assigns a role based on quantity and quality of the engagement.\n\n>## Eligibility\nThe below list contains all users eligible for a boost, their respective level, and the allocation of mainnet REP they are entitled to receive. Active DXdao contributors are not eligible for this initiative, and have been removed from the list. Anyone nominated for a traditional community REP boost is still eligible for this initiative, since high levels are difficult to obtain and the REP is distributed quarterly instead of monthly.\n\n>Although the entitlement is in mainnet REP, it is highly advised that community members request their REP via xDXdao - where governance contract interaction is a fraction of a cent. Anyone is welcome to reach out to @KeenanLuke, or any other community member involved with governance, requesting a small amount of xDai to make their REP request proposal and start voting!\n\n>If no concerns have arisen within a few days of this post being live, @KeenanLuke will create a signal proposal on xDai to update this initiative. If the proposal passes, @KeenanLuke will notify those who are eligible and assist in the claiming process by updating the “DXdao Discord REP Boost Guide 1”. A dedicated channel for the Discord REP boosts will be opened in the Governance category of the DXdao Discord, where eligible participants will be notified.\n\nSuccessful passage of this proposal greenlights eligible Discord participants to their respective mainnet REP allocation, to be claimed VIA xDAI.","title":"Signal Proposal for DXdao Discord REP Boosts Q3 2021","hash":"QmWVHkosqs1ULQ2fP1RYpMdm7JciMnLFBfzqbGsYy1FmMM"},"0xca1bd1c66bb5212797e165cca04d7394d437b6480b350b98d4ccf871e9e306ac":{"description":"\n\nThis proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

Will focus on continuing to collaborate with the dxgov team, contributing to the guilds MVP, and supporting dxvote\n\nThe reason I am just now submitting my proposal is due to the fact that only now I have a clear date of when I will be able to commit to a full-time contribution. Before that, this period was mainly time off (denver+transition) and some small contributions.\n\nThe commitment time for this proposal will be based on hours that I will update at the end of the period along with the payment details and proper daily worksheet.\n\n_______\n\n\n## Last period review:\nFor the last two months of the trial period, the main objective continued to be technical onboarding in general, being the main responsibility to contribute to the dxgov team. Everything went pretty well, I think the not-so-good part is related to being part-time and not being able to spend more time on dxdao stuff.\n\n### Went well:\nI consider the amount/nature of tickets/issues I worked on was reasonable in terms of contributing to dxgov team and the learning process for me. I mainly worked on Guilds, I have now more understanding of what we are building, how we are doing it, and the end goal. Contract interaction tasks were a great opportunity to further get familiarized with dxdao contracts. These past months were notable in terms of teamwork, not only to get to know each other but to get used to working together (at least for me), where team communication has been efficient when needed. I feel much more comfortable with the operation of the dao in general, being something completely unknown to me in the previous months. At the end of this period, ethdenver happened, which was an amazing opportunity to meet almost everyone, this event was a relevant factor when making my decision to continue contributing here.\n\n### Could be better:\nBeing part-time is quite limiting in all possible aspects: technical learning, getting involved with the DAO, participating in meetings, being available in the chat, being able to do something more than simply what the issue indicates, etc. Communication was decent but I could not be on a day-to-day basis. That will be something to improve in the next period. It would also be helpful to spend some time doing contract development since at some point could result in a smoother process for FE development. Also would like to spend more time doing code reviews.\n\n### Last period contributions:\n- [PR-509 - Vesting contract interaction modal with redeem action](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/509)\n- [PR-529 - Update nvm version & remove package-lock file](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/529)\n- [PR-534 - Add pagination to proposal fetching](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/534)\n- [PR-545 - Rename xdai to Gnosis chain](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/545)\n- [PR-549 - Add integration tests (Cypress implementation)](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/549)\n- [PR-587 - Fetch/show guild instance config data](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/587)\n- [PR-557 - Guild config data (Closed due swr implementation)](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/557)\n- [PR-604 - Remove proposals context](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/604)\n- [PR-601 - Get voting power data for guilds](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/601)\n- [PR-621 - Show member sidebar](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/621)\n- [PR-641 - Create proposal page](https://github.com/DXgovernance/dxvote/pull/641)\n\n_______\n\n## Timeframe:\n2 months.

At every conference I see products improving and evolving, but mostly tech serving other tech. The insdustry is booming, but in a nascent stage and sadly there are not many real retail users for a lack of use cases. Some non-infra protocols, and dapps that don’t serve other crypto businesses, are hoping to attract users that would invest capital, but most users with capital are addresses from 2017, and the poor mass retail have no sizeable money to invest or disposable funds to experiment/risk with new innovative tech, rather expect to farm and dump airdrops. At least the decentralized infra is getting more robust, to lay a foundation for future protocols and dapps that will properly cater to end users. Everything moves fast and devs are too busy building, not much time is given to research, reflecting and planning.\n\nHakcathons are to attract devs, inspire innovation, interoperability. Infinite won the hearts of hackers who loved the welcoming environment that was created for them. Some came back from EthGlobal saying it’s boring with the same sponsors each time, confining their creativity. It took a lot of effort, it weighed heavy on many people, but in the end compared to other hackathons done with 10x more funds, it was a success. It helped with organic marketing, affirming DXdao as an entity in the space, and bonding with peer orgs and their communities. However, if the DAO is cutting on budget, and not looking to hire hackers, organizing a hackathon isn’t an efficient initiative.\n\nThe time during the annual team-building retreat was used wisely. It was intense. It was hard to tackle difficult subjects that affect the whole org, its place in the industry, and everyone contributing to it. Lateral tried to help as much as possible professionally with guided sessions/workshops.\n\nI have personally decided to take an indefinite /very long/ hiatus, not just from DXdao, but the industry as a whole. Keenan will help me step down from being daotalk admin, discord community support, telegram channels admin, and I also won’t be acitive in keybase.\n\nFor this last period, with the help of the collective I:\n- liaised with TallyHo to align communities and co-market the Web3 pledge.\n- represented DXdao at Dappcon in Berlin, and gave a talk on DAOs in DeFi\n- did a Twitter Spaces AMA with SafeTreasury, representing DXdao\n- did a Metamouse market research on fiat spending DAOs and Web3 projects, hoping to feature DXdao in an article in TechCrunch, CoinTelegraph and CoinDesk, but haven’t seen it live yet.\n- got Mike from Poolshark Protocol present a novel price time priority order book on the weekly biz dev call. I asked SpaceInch to help analyse the opportunity as we don’t have enough dev resource to evaluate and act on, but the DAO has disengaged from SpaceInch.\n- helped get Swarm Association join Infinite Hackathons and Genesis Bogota last minute; happy to have actively contributed to attracting three of the four co-orgs\n- liaised with BanklessDAO and DeWork to implement the co-marketing initiatives for Infinite Hackathons\n- created a profile allowing Infinite to use Devpost for Genesis Bogota\n- got DXD token on Bubblemaps and coordinated co-marketing\n- attended a couple of meetings of the newly formed Carrot product UX/UI squad and joined discussions\n- saved 33k COW /peanuts in usd/ from being incorrectly allocated to farmers due to a discrepancy in the UI.

The upcoming Lisbon Blockchain week appears to be a great opportunity to hold such a retreat. Not only is Lisbon an up and coming tech-hub, but its geographical positioning is also convenient for the majority of DXdao contributors - being easy to reach for both European based contributors as well as those in the Americas.\n\nLisbon Blockchain week runs from the 18th to the 24th of October, with the following events already scheduled (and more to be announced):\n\n[LisCon](https://liscon.org/) 20-21 October\n\n[ETHLisbon 2](https://www.ethlisbon.org/) 22-24 October\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThis proposal suggests a DXRetreat to take place the week before the Lisbon Blockchain week. Namely, from the 10th of October until the 17th.\n\nThis proposal aims to cover all accommodation costs from the 10th to the 25th of October. As well as a budget for team building and workshops during the DXRetreat.\n\nAn informal poll showed interest from ~17ish people to attend. After receiving some initial quotes for accommodation, €15k seems a reasonable amount to plan with. This comes out to roughly €60 per person per night. Moreover, a budget of €5k seems to be reasonable to cover activities / workshops during the DXRetreat week.\n\nThe accommodation prices above are estimates, as it ultimately depends on the number of people attending. However, we need to reserve those places as soon as possible, as there already is a very limited selection of places available in Lisbon to accommodate such a large group. The idea behind using the MS, is that MS signers can verify bills and only disperse exact amounts.\n\nThe further €5k is for workshops and team building activities during the DXRetreat (10th to 15th). Which, with an attendance of 17 people comes down to ~€50 per day per person. Nothing has been booked yet, but when we do want to book something, we’ll have to move quickly with the payment and passing an 8 day on-chain proposal everytime we want to book something seems highly inefficient. For this, this proposal authorizes €5k to be sent to the MS. \n\n**Funds**\n\nThis proposal sends a total of €20k ($25k USD) to the DXdao MS wallet - from which funds can be drawn gradually to cover costs. Retaining the funds in the MS adds a layer of security. Any eventual remaining funds at the end, will be returned to the DXdao treasury.\n\n**Notes**\n\nFurther proposals will likely be created to cover costs for Lisbon Blockchain week - such as funds for sponsorship, covering transport for contributors as well as daily allowances. This proposal is submitted first, due to the urgency of booking accommodations in time.\n\nThis proposal is submitted on Mainnet as a signal and funding proposal and also submitted on xDai as solely a signal proposal.\n","title":"[Signal Proposal] DXRetreat 2021 - Lisbon","hash":"Qmcfez1yqPLVsiPXBYhxZXQ79tVRzu3z68xDAB2i9rF5yA"},"0xdbdfd60c26df23cdfc6959fcf9e1c4094a5b236a0bc4b0a56670e2868d7ad336":{"description":"Request to send 300 xDai to GnosisProtocolRelayer","title":"Send 300 xDai to GnosisProtocolRelayer","hash":"Qma64ieUgc6DANXLnCV5gHZuqiecfCbuVn5uQm4pLvbDR8"},"0xde25104b7ff7b0704c8ca560749ad927d1d718e5636579c73431079004720fbb":{"description":"Looking forward to Colombia.\n\nBelow are the details for upcoming DXColombia Contributor Stipend and travel request for SkyMine Labs:\n\n[DXColombia Contributor Stipend:](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0x62fb4da3c53ae8c70710acf49f9771a7f7b84ec36ce502a65dc2fd57f592bfc5)\n\n* Transportation - $1,250\n* Accommodation - $2,100\n* Daily stipend - $1,125\n* DevCon tik - $299\n\nDXColombia Total: $4,774\n\nPayout Request in this Proposal: 4,774 xDAI","title":" SkyMine Labs - DXColombia Contributor Stipend Request ","hash":"QmcU2wNx4sGVRCAbyPQBVHnSo3LAZKdmjPyJYsWfVBJbuV"},"0xde5cd6bc6a883bbdc9f30b3088e5d6d4d6ae49601a1d542ac01516f3cc9dfee5":{"description":"This proposal places a WETH/xDXD order on Gnosis Protocol v1 on xDai, using the [GP Relayer](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0xA369a0b81ee984a470EA0acf41EF9DdcDB5f7B46/transactions).

I guess, this is it now, below./\nSummary of and reflection on my work to help you evaluate my contribution and arrive at a decision. /I will not rush to submit this to Alchemy until a few days later, giving you time to comment if you feel the need for it./:\n\nAs a business developer, I primarily care about raising public awareness of our products, growing our satisfied user base and stakeholders’ value, through work on both B2B & D2C relations. Although, personally, my alignment with the DAO is first and foremost ideological, and far less financial, I do wish to be an active member of the organization and be able to participate in decision making, so the time has come to revisit my worker proposal and hopefully earn my first reputation. I may forget to mention something, but here it is:\n\nInitially, I needed to get a feel of the status quo, so I conducted a survey as an attempt to gain a better understanding of our strengths and weaknesses as an organisation. The results showed me the conviction shared by the team, which was only dampened by the unanimous acknowledgement of the lack of time and human resource as our primary hurdle in acting on our ambition. I found this information of great benefit.\n\nThat led me to dedicating time trying to attract skilled contributors to our organization. I am glad my search brought good results.\nI can call Melanie a friend, as she has been very helpful to me, and also it really warms my heart when she reaches out to me, whenever I can be of assistance.\n\nI use the time-zone difference to help keep an eye on our social media channels /Discord, Telegram/ at odd hours and chime in whenever community members need help. I try to be active and promote our services organically without overdoing it, not to achieve the opposite effect and turn someone away.\n\nI also began creating memes, which in my opinion are valuable brand assets /a picture is worth a thousand words/. Interestingly enough, it is helping me with stress as well. I will also start sharing those on my Twitter feed.\n\nI have been attending the daily calls of the Mesa team. I tried to attract a very skilled developer to come on board and fill the gap in our dev team. At one point it was almost a sure thing, but in the end it didn’t work out. I am also trying to find a studio to outsource the front end work. There is one which might work out soon, but it’s not a done deal yet. I am also happy helping Martin and Nico with the documentation. In general, I definitely see my presence in the squad as a positive, supporting the team and sharing opinion when I am able to. In a recent chat with Keenan and Zett we discussed how important it is for a team to be able to keep up the pace in the absence of the lead. I can attest that when Martin took a few days off for a holiday, Adam, Hamza, Nico and I kept working and communicating without disruption.\n\nIt is somewhat a similar experience with the marketing and communications squad. I have been happily attending meetings whenever possible and I do believe that my input brings value in reaching consensus and the overall decision making process. I hope that I’ve made it clear that I am always sharing my honest opinion and speaking my mind without reservation, yet luckily, my character isn’t such that I’d expect things to go my way /there is no ‘mI way’, only the WEi/. Given the limited resources, I believe the squad is doing great. Thanks to Keenan and John, tere are amazing people joining us lately and I’m very optimistic and excited for what’s to come.\n\nFor fear of jinxing it, I try to avoid mentioning something before I have good reasons to believe it may happen. There are businesses I have had or I am still having conversations with. There are also others that I haven’t even successfully gotten throught to yet /not for the lack of trying/. One hardly ever knows with certainty when an initiative will fall through or one will manage to pull it through within a desired timeframe. It takes both patience and perseverance, one just has to constantly keep being creative and move forward. It can mess up sleep and one can’t tell a week day from the weekend, but when you love what you do, it doesn’t take too big of a toll. Sometimes a breakthrough can be achieved in just an hour, somethimes it takes months. Also, at times one comes up with ideas that don’t meet wide approval, but for me it is just a part of the process of thinking outside the box.\n\nIt took a while, but we finally managed to get Swapr on CoingGecko.\nWith Sky’s support and building on his prior relationship with 1inch, we are officially in the queue to list Swapr.\nFollowing up on John’s idea and with Keenan and Federico’s help we got Swapr on DeFi Llama.\nIn the near future we’ll consider DeFi Pulse.\nTogether with Keenan we’re working on getting DXdao, Swapr and Omen on DeBank. We might need everyone’s support to upvote a proposal soon, but first Keenan will pull some strings.\nWe’ve got a promise to get Swapr on LiquidityFolio.\nWe’ve got contacts at ETH Global, and we’ll revisit the connection with a solid plan moving forward once we have a fully-formed marketing and communictions squad.\nThere is interest to explore a partnership with the team at GitCoin, involving Omen, Mesa and Swapr. To be revisited in July as per their request.\nWe have initiated contact with organizations that can bring DXventures in on investment opportunities, in our pursuit of supporting teams tackling pain points in DeFi, in order to help grow the ecosystem. This will also be benefitial to our product suite, especially Mesa and Swapr.\nWith the support from John, Geronimo, Sky and Chris, we took productive steps to improve our relationship with the team at xDai, resulting in really exciting developments.\nSelf-Relfection:\nI acknowledge that I personally could have definitely done a better job. There’s this saying I like a lot: “Don’t move the way fear makes you move. Move the way love makes you move.” Hardly anyone does this in their worker proposals, buy I wish to convey to you what I expect from you. I’ve mentioned in previous posts that data is the new gold, and that communication is the key to successful teams. We’re doing great, but starting with myself, let’s all please, move even more out of love, and less out of fear. Please forgive me if I’ve done something out of fear, it’s not who I am nor I want to be. Whatever I do comes from my heart.\n\nGoals:\nI was recently reminded by the contributor experience squad that this proposal is a bit overdue and that within the next two weeks I’ll have to follow up with a proposal for the next period. When I first submitted my proposal I couldn’t have included any of the above, because honestly I had no clue what would happen. I only knew that I wanted to give it my best. I hope the results are not disappointing. There is a lot to follow up on, and a lot more to achieve. I’m sure many new opportunities will spring up, but I’ll struggle a little trying to be precize in what to expect to be delivered in the next period, apart from assuring you that I’m commiting to the cause again at 100%.\n\nThe more you help me, the more I can help, and I believe we’ve all done great. Thank you!\n\nExperience: please see the two links at the beginning of the proposal.\n\nCommitment:\nFull-time: 40h+ week\nLevel: 1\nRequest is for 2.5 months, with 1.5 months /6 weeks/ on date of proposal’s approval, and the remaining 1 month /4 weeks/ due on end of proposal period.\nREP: 0.175% on approval of proposal – for the first 6 weeks; + 0.1333% at the end of period – for its last 4 weeks.\nDXD: On the day of proposal approval, $2100 /4DXD/ locked with 50% vesting after 1 year of the worker contract start date /03/16/21/, and the remaining 50% is vested through a linear schedule after the 1-year cliff, fully vested at 2 years.

The task is completed, so the code was reviewd and checked with approvals. Currently is ready to be merged. The PR can be found on Swapr-dapp github repo: feature/upgrade-wallet-library by karczuRF · Pull Request #1330 · levelkdev/swapr-dapp · GitHub.\n\nThe second task LP-Zapping is brand new feature in Swapr. It allows to swap any token for 2 different tokens and add liquidity to the pool with just 1-click. It works also in another direction, so allows to remove liquidity from the pool and swap pool’s tokens to any different token, obviously also with 1-click. It is worth mentioning that zap feature is innovative as allows to use any DEX supported by Swapr, so with EcoRouter zapping is cost optimized and flexible. It is also prepared to use it with new DEXs if needed. To achieve it Oskar by himself has written brand new Zap smart contract (with test) and deployed it on Goerli testnet and Gnosis network. Also he fully adjusted Swapr frontend to use Zap contract, so dedicated designs and user-flow components were added. Currently Zap feature is waiting to be tested by QA and reviewed. The PR can be found on Swapr-dapp github repo: Feat/lp zapping by karczuRF · Pull Request #1596 · levelkdev/swapr-dapp · GitHub.\n\nIn the meanwhile Oskar was doing daily routines, like reviewing the code or discussing project development.\n\nMarek Kowalski:\nMarek handles code reviews, project oversight and architectural proposals.\n\nJosh Segall:\nJosh provides general oversight and strategic advice about roadmaps, product, and process.\n\nCompensation\n\nWork Completed from November 1 - 30, 2022\n\nTotal Price = $8,704\n\nLink to Master Services Agreement and Scope of Work 2\n\nLink to SOW for Project #2 Development Work Proposal for Space Inch - Project #2\n\nExperience\n\nSpace Inch started in 2010 by making mobile games and produced 90 million installs of original and published games.

This is to be paid in two installments: one as soon as possible for the reservation purposes and the second 10 days before the event.\n\nThis cost includes accommodation and breakfast for 22 contributors and 3 facilitators from Lateral for 5 nights, transportation to and from the location from Cartagena and exclusive use of the accommodations. The accommodations will be closed just for DXdao, for the first 4 nights.\n\nFor the food & beverages, it will be à la carte, so it will depend on the actual consumptions, but we estimate about 5,900 USD total for the 5 days.\n\nFor other activities, this will depend on a more detailed design of the retreat and exploration of possibilities. However, we have already completed preliminary research and estimate 5,000 USD to cover these additional costs.\n\nIn total this proposal is requesting 108034107.66 COP or 25,000 USD.\n\n## Funds\n\nThis proposal sends a total of $25K USD to the DXdao MS wallet - from which funds can be drawn gradually to cover costs.

This last period was full of surprises, stress and most importantly - accomplishment. Much of our work in the previous months has culminated in the SWPR token and farming launch on Arbitrum - to what can only be described as a resounding success thus far.

Within my first non-trial period proposal I had indicated a “long term career goal of attaining experience level 5 within 2 years.”. Since that proposal I have transitioned from a support to a lead, made DXdao and its products my primary focus, and coordinated many initiatives including the operation of the newly established DXvoice squad. I have received incredible support from other DXdao contributors regarding a level increase from 4 to 5, representing me reaching my personal goals far before I had anticipated.
