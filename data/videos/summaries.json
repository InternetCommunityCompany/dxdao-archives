    "summary": "The meeting transcript discusses the decentralized autonomous organization DXdao and highlights its unique approach to product ownership and governance in the crypto space. The key points from the transcript are:\n\n1. DXdao is a sovereign collective that is global, remote-only, and crypto-native.\n2. Participation in DXdao's governance requires community members to earn non-transferable reputation (REP) tokens by contributing directly to the DAO.\n3. The organization uses a highly scalable decentralized on-chain governance system with holographic consensus.\n4. DXdao consists of over 400 addresses and manages a treasury worth millions.\n5. The organization focuses on the importance of decentralization for secure and permissionless access to the new economy, especially in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n6. DXdao operates differently from centralized domains by deploying apps through the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which ensures the front-end is owned and controlled by the decentralized community, enhancing anti-fragility and censorship resistance.\n7. DXdao uses ENS domain names like dxdow.eth, swapr.eth, and omen.eth, which are trustlessly controlled by Ethereum addresses governed by the DAO.\n8. The apps' front ends are hosted on decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing systems, and changes to ENS domain names must be approved by the DAO through an on-chain governance proposal.\n9. DXdao has been functioning in this decentralized manner since the middle of 2019, setting an example for others in the decentralized space."

    "summary": "Key points from the DXdao community call on October 28th:\n\n1. DXdao has been executing a DXD buyback program for five to six months, purchasing back tokens to potentially reduce circulating supply and increase the value of remaining tokens. They are about to extend the maximum buyback amount from three to four million dollars.\n\n2. The Swapper farming update includes new epochs going live. The focus is primarily on Arbitrum Mainnet and xDai, with an 80/10/10 percentage split between the three chains for Swapper rewards.\n\n3. Lisbon Blockchain Week was a significant event for DXdao, with contributors attending a retreat, participating in the DAOist event, and co-hosting a happy hour and panel discussion on the future of prediction markets.\n\n4. Discussion on optimizing the Swapper farming strategy, such as potentially extending epoch lengths for core pairs across different chains to reduce the frequency of stakers having to re-stake, and reassessing the allocation of Swapper rewards between chains.\n\n5. Single-sided staking for Swapper is being worked on, with contracts currently in testing stages. This model allows holders to earn yields on their Swapper tokens without providing liquidity to pools.\n\n6. The DXdao community is considering attending future blockchain-related events after the successful participation in Lisbon, potentially including EthDenver and Devcon, among others.\n\n7. There's continued excitement and development around the future of DXdao products, such as Omen prediction markets and the upcoming Carrot programmable incentives project."

A transfer of 500,000 sUSD is proposed to be converted into DAI and USDC and bridged over to the Gnosis chain base, set to pass in the following week, after which the execution will be required.\n\n2. The reasoning behind using sUSD for the transfer is due to the reevaluation of stable coins in the crypto market, especially after the LUNA/UST event, and the intention to use the riskier stable coins such as sUSD or USDT first before depleting DAI and USDC reserves on the mainnet.\n\n3. DXdao is currently low on funds on the Gnosis chain due to high activity but expects to replenish those funds on Monday.\n\n4. Proposals for REP syncs are occurring for Venky, Sky Mine Labs, and Medusa on the mainnet. A point of discussion was the correct amount of REP and the discrepancies in the mainnet REP because many REP transactions are only reflected on the Gnosis chain, not the mainnet.\n\n5. The system of REP inflation is considered good as it reflects an active and growing DAO. The suggestion is to use absolute numbers for REP issuance, rather than percentages, which would simplify REP synchronization across chains.\n\n6. The Daoist DAO proposes DXdao to become a key member, offering ministerial support positions. DXdao is encouraged to make a decision sooner than later due to limited availability at the proposed price.\n\n7. DXdao is organizing contributor stipends for Devcon and a DXdao retreat happening in October, which includes costs for daily stipend, transportation, accommodation, and potential visa costs.\n\n8.

    "summary": "Key points from the DXdao governance discussion on January 26th:\n\n1. DXD Buyback Extension: A proposal to extend the buyback program by an additional $1 million was passed, translating to an extension for 305 Ether due to recent market volatility. The funds will be channeled through DXdao's multisig on Mainnet and transferred to the GP v1 relay on Gnosis Chain, which simplifies the process and reduces the number of necessary proposals. An additional 10 Ether will be wrapped and deposited into the xDai Treasury for claims.\n\n2. Hats Proposal: This proposal involves sending 790 DXD to the Hats Finance vault, roughly equivalent to $1 million at the time of the meeting but likely less due to market changes.\n\n3. Swapr Deposits: Two separate proposals were discussed to provide liquidity on Swapr with a significant sum of 415 Ether and 1.15 million xDai. Due to market fluctuation, the amounts could vary at the time of execution, but the liquidity injection into Swapr is a deliberate and desired action.\n\n4. Bonding Curve Reimbursement: A proposal was submitted by Trent to get refunded roughly 130 USDC that was sent accidentally to the DXdao bonding curve. There is confidence that the bonding curve can be upgraded, and though the funds are not an immediate priority, a reimbursement was proposed to resolve the issue quickly.\n\n5. Governance Process: The discussion included the example of Trent’s proposal as a success of the governance process, showing how issues can be addressed through community discussion and proposals.\n\n6. Technical Considerations and Warnings: A significant part of the discussion was dedicated to the technicalities of sending native currency (ETH/xDai) to smart contracts using DAOstack schemes, the differences between EOA and smart contracts, and the potential of making errors that could result in lost funds. It was brought up that there should be public documentation on these matters and warnings built into tools like DXvote to prevent mistakes.\n\n7. Ongoing Governance: The meeting ended with a preview of new content, the promotion of recent posts on DXdao's \"DXgov Recap\" and discussions on increasing on-chain liquidity, suggesting that these topics would likely be visited in future governance discussions."

The team made a detailed presentation about Nimi, its vision, target audience, features like gasless updates, IPFS pinning, and UI/UX improvements. They also talked about potential social features and selling points like hosting content for creators and organizations and incorporating on-chain friendships and social circles.\n\n4. Two deal structures were proposed for Nimi's future development. The first involved a grant of $150k for 5% future equity or tokens, while the second involved $100k for 10% with a commitment that the team would continue to work for DXdao while developing Nimi.\n\n5. There was a general sense that a hybrid model would be beneficial, where DXdao retains some ownership and the Nimi team can continue to have responsibilities within DXdao while preparing for an outside raise and potentially moving to full-time development with Nimi.\n\n6. The importance of being able to act quickly and raise capital outside of DXdao was emphasized. Also, the point was made that DXdao should be agile and make faster decisions regarding incubating new projects.\n\n7. The team acknowledged that there may be a need to transition responsibilities within the existing projects as members start focusing on Nimi.\n\n8. Ideas for how to create and distribute content highlighting DXdao's approach to privacy included Twitter threads, community calls, Operation Decentralization, a special focus on privacy in the next broadcast, and creating videos that explain how Swapper can be used privately.\n\n9. The meeting closed with the idea of discussing Infinite and Bogota in the next DX Voice call due to time constraints. Participants were encouraged to be active in community discussions on DowTalk and Keybase."

Etherisc focuses on parametric insurance and has a system powered by data sources, such as flight databases or weather data, to determine insurance payouts automatically through smart contracts.\n\n2. They plan to use blockchain to provide fully automated and fair insurance systems that exclude legal promises in favor of technical guarantees for lower-value and consumer-friendly insurance products.\n\n3. Etherisc is exploring a second token sale using a bonding curve and the Gnosis Protocol for fundraising to develop new products like wallet insurance, crop insurance, and a more user-friendly interface to build insurance products. They also plan to implement a staking model for risk pools.\n\n4. DXdao is encouraged to support Etherisc’s proposal to list their DIP token on Mesa, a decentralized exchange built by Gnosis.\n\n5. The discussion shifted to DXdao’s strategy related to xDai, a side-chain for Ethereum with lower transaction costs. This included the potential of moving DXdao products like Omen and Mesa to xDai to capitalize on the smaller transaction costs.\n\n6. It was suggested that DXdao could act as an oracle option for Omen on xDai.\n\n7. Running their own node on xDai by DXdao was discussed with the caveat that it poses trust and risk management issues since the DAO cannot technically run the node themselves.\n\n8. Concerns were raised about how liquidity might not move in large quantities to xDai, but it was noted that it's still valuable for DXdao to position itself on xDai as it's beneficial for testing deployment on other chains and could be an advantage if liquidity on xDai unexpectedly grows.\n\n9. There was interest in looking into ways DXdao could possibly drive liquidity to xDai, specifically focusing on Omen as a priority due to its suitability for the side-chain.\n\n10. The conversation concluded with suggestions about future blog posts and actions to promote the use of xDai."

    "summary": "Here's a summary of the key points discussed in the DXdao token group call:\n\n1. **Recap of Previous Calls:** The first call detailed the history of DXdao and the DXD token, and the second call explored comparable project token models.\n\n2. **Current DXD Liquidity Concerns:** DXD continues to trade far below NAV despite a 30% reduction in supply, posing a negative perception. Gnosis Protocol V1 has caused some liquidity challenges, which led to a switch to Cow Protocol for the buyback process.\n\n3. **DXD Tokens and Liquidity Enhancement:** The group discussed potential strategies to get DXD closer to NAV, suggesting a two-pronged approach with mainnet and Gnosis Chain. They considered executing smaller market orders to manage slippage, using a mix of ETH and stablecoins for purchases, and gradually submitting limit orders to provide price support.\n\n4. **New DXT Token Model:** The group outlined ideas for a new token model to create a sustainable long-term strategy. The proposed pillars included price floor support, absorbing sell pressure (via inverse DXD bonds), the ability to mint new DXD, and ensuring a liquid market for DXD.\n\n5. **Inverse DXD Bonds:** A concept of inverse DXD bonds was discussed where DXT could be staked for a certain period to receive a percentage of the treasury NAV, with various parameters to adapt to the needs of different token holders.\n\n6. **Treasury Management:** There was a focus on how to improve the utilization of DXdao's treasury to extract more yield. The group highlighted that only a portion of the treasury is currently being utilized for yield generation and considered strategies for better deployment, including liquidity provision on Curve and Swapper.\n\n7. **Participation of Kaparki:** A representative from Kaparki introduced their platform, which could potentially aid in treasury management by executing strategies within predefined parameters set by DXdao.\n\n8. **Future Considerations:** The group discussed the need for better reporting, risk management, and flexible execution mechanisms for treasury management, which might be addressed by platforms like Kaparki's Zodiac module. They also considered the balance between offering liquidity for DXD and managing the treasury for other initiatives.\n\nThe call ended with reminders to continue discussions on liquidity, the DXT token model, and treasury management, with an immediate task being the execution of a carrot campaign."

Guilds and Funding:\n   - Discussions around how the approved guilds will be funded, managed, and tested are underway; concerns were raised about the amount of funds being put into newly created governance tools (guilds) without sufficient testing.\n   - It was suggested that funds be transferred gradually to the guilds, which need to establish their own multi-sig wallets and decide on testing parameters like proposal length.\n   - There is a requirement to transfer funds to Gnosis Chain for the ongoing payments to contributors and operations, which would potentially start from mid-January.\n\n5. Testing and Deployment of Guilds:\n   - The guilds are currently being deployed on Gnosis Chain, and plans to test them thoroughly, including testing proposal execution and token attribution.\n   - The Guilds will appear on the Project Davi platform, and there is an intention to be cautious about the funds that are transferred to the Guilds initially.\n\n6. Multi-Sig Wallets:\n   - The need for each Guild to have its own multi-sig wallet, as well as suggestions on how to structure these multi-sigs, was discussed.\n\n7. Governance and Evolution:\n   - The discussion emphasized organic growth and cautious implementation, with each Guild evolving its governance processes over time, starting with foundational elements like the forum for the Guild.\n\n8. Next Meeting:\n   - The meeting ended with a mention that the next governance discussion would take place in 2023."

    "summary": "Key points from the DXdao governance discussion:\n\n1. **Gas refunds**: The DAO has been spending a significant amount on Ethereum gas fees (around 21.68 ETH for a seven-week period) primarily on worker compensation proposals and rep rewards. There's a discussion on making the process more efficient and possibly utilizing a bot for automatic transaction executions.\n\n2. **The bot debate**: Questions arise on whether individual executions by users should be refunded, and how to handle bot funding when it runs out of money. Suggestions include funding the bot with personal money and then asking for reimbursement, or decentralizing the process by having multiple bots.\n\n3. **Reducing governance costs**: To save on governance costs, the DAO could reduce the number of individual votes per proposal, possibly even batching worker proposals or having fewer votes on each (while maintaining a minimum for safety).\n\n4. **Worker compensation**: There's dialogue on how to streamline worker compensation proposals, possibly updating them less frequently unless there are changes to levels or commitments.\n\n5. **XDXdao (DXdao on xDai)**: The XDXdao is seen as a separate entity with its own governance, potentially overseeing products on the xDai chain and offering low-cost governance execution for proposals, bounties, and signaling votes. However, there is debate on how the XDXdao will be perceived as representing or connected to the main DXdao on Ethereum, with some suggesting it gains legitimacy through a step-by-step process starting with smaller responsibilities.\n\n6. **DxD ERC20 guilds**: The DAO is working on ERC20 guilds, which could impact governance structure, such as having a DXD guild for token holders. Multiple questions remain, including how much reputation to assign and whether the guilds should have governance influence.\n\n7. **Governance 2.0 working group**: Plans to submit a proposal for forming a governance 2.0 working group focused on DXdao's future governance model, including potential participants from both DXdao and outside the organization.\n\nOverall, the discussion revolved around how to make governance more cost-effective, whether to decentralize certain processes, and how the DXdao can expand its governance mechanisms, possibly on sidechains like xDai, to include new types of proposals and broaden participation."

    "summary": "Key points from the meeting transcript:\n\n1. Consensus Dashboard: A tool was created to track consensus on various items discussed.\n   - 0.25% protocol fee largely agreed upon.\n   - More discussion needed on DXD/ETH incentives and other LP incentives.\n   - Consensus still needed on three initial deployment pools.\n\n2. DX Swap Strategy Plan: \n   - Geared towards gaining consensus on launch proposals, initial fees, base pairs, relayer details, and incentives.\n   - Timeline for launch includes several stages, such as liquidity provision shortly after launch, conditional token yield farming in the following weeks or months, router aggregation for including Uniswap pools, and LP guild governance with an updated UI several months later.\n   - The Deployer smart contracts are the core of DX Swap.\n\n3. DXD/ETH Pool: \n   - Consensus against using DXdao's treasury to provide liquidity for DXD/ETH pair.\n   - An omen market is proposed as a bounty to incentivize DXD deposits on DX Swap with the outcome contingent on the pool's size by a certain date.\n   - If a liquidity threshold isn't met by a specified date, DXdao may provide liquidity from the treasury.\n\n4. Liquidity Incentives:\n   - The idea of conditional token yield farming was discussed as a method to incentivize liquidity provision.\n   - It was suggested that traditional rewards programs may also be needed alongside the new conditional yield farming strategy since conditional markets still need finetuning.\n\n5. Pool Governance:\n   - Short-term DXdao will manage pool fees.\n   - Medium-term an LP (Liquidity Provider) guild could manage these fees.\n   - Long-term pair governance and liquidity pool governance could be important as well.\n\n6. Branding and Naming of DX Swap:\n   - There is a discussion about whether to rebrand DX Swap to align with a broader vision of what the platform could become.\n   - Several voices advocate for keeping the existing brand for the imminent launch, while others suggest considering a holistic brand that can accommodate future developments.\n\n7. Timeline to Launch:\n   - The proposal to resolve the ENS domain is targeted for mid-November.\n   - The main net contract deployment is expected next week, following which the ENS proposal can be set up.\n   - There is a call for swift decision-making to keep to the planned timelines.\n\nThe discussion covers multiple aspects of DX Swap, including governance, incentives, initial liquidity provision, and brand strategy, with a focus on reaching consensus ahead of an impending launch while also contemplating the platform’s long-term trajectory."

    "summary": "The key points from the DXdao meeting transcript are as follows:\n\n1. Alon mentioned an ongoing effort to create a replica of the DXdao on the xDai blockchain. To achieve this, Gnosis Safe wallets would need to map to xDai addresses using a custom contract. A signaling contract link was shared for this purpose, and the goal is to deploy the xDai DAO by October 1st.\n\n2. Alon also indicated that the xDai DAO could act as a less expensive platform for funding various initiatives because of reduced transaction costs compared to Ethereum mainnet, and proposed quarterly updates for reputation mapping between xDai and mainnet to maintain parity.\n\n3. Omen received positive attention from Vitalik Buterin on Twitter, leading to a spike in the Telegram group membership. There was a discussion on the potential integration of Omen with rollups, such as Loopring, and issues regarding high gas estimations were addressed. A conditional token explorer is in development to allow wrapping of tokens for trading on Loopring.\n\n4. Mesa has a new release with a feature to estimate the minimum trade necessary for solvers to be incentivized and cover gas costs. Work has been done on a traditional order book UI, and Mesa may soon support xDai trading.\n\n5. DXswap is nearing launch, with a discussion on its parameters, governance, and audits.

    "summary": "The DXdao governance discussion on September 16, 2020, covered several key topics:\n\n1. Delphi Digital Report: The meeting began with the presentation of Delphi Digital's analysis on DXdao’s governance. The report focused on governance changes, incentivizing both existing 'REP whales' and new members, and the introduction of capital at risk as a consideration for voting power.\n\n2. Three Pillars of Voting Power: Delphi Digital proposed a new voting power structure based on three pillars: DXD staked, REP balance, and future days staked. This model suggested that DXD be used as a base voting power, REP serve as a multiplier, and future days staked reflect long-term commitment to the DAO.\n\n3. REP Multiplier and Inflation: The Delphi Digital team presented the idea of a REP multiplier that would provide more voting power to those who had earned REP via past contributions. They also discussed a model for REP issuance as an incentive for newcomers to join and actively participate in the DAO.\n\n4. Future Stake Commitment: The proposal emphasized the importance of future stake commitment by reducing voting power for members who did not commit to locking their tokens for a certain period.\n\n5. Decentralization and Transparency: There was a discussion about the need for better transparency linking DXD and REP holdings by members, as well as the need for improved decentralization within the DAO as the top 10 REP holders wielded significant power.\n\n6. UI Improvements and Layer 2 Voting: Delphi Digital proposed improvements to the user interface and the implementation of Layer 2 voting to reduce costs and enhance usability.\n\n7. Concerns and Feedback: Some attendees raised concerns that the proposals might disregard ongoing work and efforts within the DAO or that they could lead to potential attack vectors if not carefully implemented.\n\n8. Overall Reception and Next Steps: The comprehensive and data-driven approach by Delphi Digital was appreciated, but it was also clear more detailed analysis and discussion are needed. The establishment of a working group to address these issues and balance the various proposals was suggested."

    "summary": "Key points from the meeting:\n\n1. Presentation by Tally Ho (Max and Ace), a community-owned web3 wallet, which aims to provide a wallet option that remains decentralized, open source, and governed by a DAO.\n2. Tally Ho is integrating with various dApps in the ecosystem and is actively looking for more integration partnerships, including DXdao’s Swapr.\n3. The wallet allows for Ethereum mainnet transactions and has native Polygon support, with plans to add Optimism and Arbitrum support soon.\n4. A fair launch for the Tally Ho governance token (may be named Doggo but subject to change) is planned, with no pre-sales or predefined allocations.\n5. Community ownership means that revenue generated from product fees such as in-wallet swap fees will flow back into the DAO for the community to decide how to best use these funds.\n6. Tally Ho plans to launch as a DAO and the governance structure is still being finalized. The team discusses how to ensure the DAO can manage necessary operations for the wallet (e.g., Google Chrome Store listing) without compromising decentralization.\n7. DXdao is working on wallet integration for Swapr and is interested in boosting the adoption of Tally Ho.\n8. The DXdao report on RAI (a decentralized stablecoin) was provided by Dave. The DAO is closely monitoring RAI's usage and potentially moving RAI to more commonly used stablecoins like DAI.\n9. DXdao is releasing a new version of DXstats and preparing the Swapper Beta15 with 0x integration.\n10. DXdao's carrot V1 is progressing, with a second audit report anticipated soon, and they are looking to ramp up the development of the front end.\n11. The DXdao had a significant presence at the ECC Paris and organized a successful networking event with Gnosis Chain, GitPo App, and Gnosis Safe. The experience in Paris suggested that in the current bear market, there is still considerable innovation in the space, and many projects are actively building and developing.\n\nThe meeting emphasized the collective efforts of DXdao and associated projects in advancing decentralized finance (DeFi), governance, and product development."

    "summary": "Key points from the meeting transcript on December 19th, 2022, regarding DXdao and the introduction of Mochi:\n\n1. Initial Discussion on Ichi:\n   - Ichi had pivoted from backing community stable tokens to active Uniswap V3 liquidity management.\n   - They created vaults that accept single-token deposits, managing liquidity actively in a concentrated range.\n   - Ichi vaults automate the movement of liquidity, increasing token liquidity significantly.\n   - Ichi offered incentives, guaranteeing a 15% return on their pools, and proposing the idea of DXdao using DxD in such vaults to increase its liquidity.\n\n2. DXdao Liquidity Considerations:\n   - Discussion on how to provide liquidity for DxD tokens and whether a low-slippage ecosystem is desirable.\n   - Considering Ichi as a market-making alternative allowing community participation.\n   - A possibility of using leverage in pools to increase liquidity and returns, potentially sharing fees earned by DXdao.\n\n3. Mochi Presentation by Gabriel:\n   - Mochi is a game-like tool for remote coordination inside communities. It's designed to help organize and engage teams.\n   - The goal is to streamline coordination of DAOs, encouraging regular team interaction without synchronous meetings.\n   - Players set and stake goals, participate in daily stand-ups (check-ins), earn tokens, and can be \"slashed\" for inactivity.\n   - Mochi's adoption can help onboard and engage community members, fostering a culture of daily involvement.\n   - Use cases include using Mochi for integrating new members into a community by guiding them through a series of tasks to be more involved.\n   - The tool has potential for DXdao to align its team, mainly as it transitions to a \"guild\" structure where teams focus on specific verticals or services.\n\n4. Further Considerations for Mochi in DXdao:\n   - The emphasis on starting small and focusing on select guilds or groups within DXdao to test out Mochi.\n   - Potential customization of Mochi to suit the management style of different DXdao guilds and their specific objectives or KPIs.\n   - The aim is to save time and increase efficiency by incorporating Mochi into DXdao's workflow."

    "summary": "The main topic of the meeting was the launch of DXdao's signaling priorities board using the ESP (Extensible Signaling Primitive) tool developed by Lewis.\n\nKey points of the meeting:\n\n1. The signaling priorities board aims to include inputs from both reputation (REP) holders and DXD token holders, with points allocation based on Gnosis Chain REP and potentially DXD holdings.\n2. There is a maximum allocation of points for each wallet, with a cap of 100 points for either having four percent REP or owning a thousand DXD.\n3. The possibility of an \"additive\" model was discussed where a wallet could hold both REP and DXD, leading to a joint voting power.\n4. Snapshots of DXD holdings will be used as the input since these quantities can change over time (buying/selling).\n5. It's encouraged for all rep holders and DXD holders to participate in establishing priorities.\n6. The ESP tool is the first live deployment of a new contract with a modular system design allowing for easy changes and additions in signaling mechanisms.\n7. There was a brief discussion about governance 2.0, which could involve locking DXD for a period of time to gain voting power, rather than using a snapshot-based system.\n8. The meeting included brief technical troubleshooting for wallet connections to the ESP tool.\n9. An event at East Denver is being sponsored by a collaboration between DXdao and Swapr, and invites will be selectively distributed.\n\nThe overall sentiment was positive, with a focus on getting participants to set priorities using the ESP tool and an interest in potential DXdao governance updates involving DXD token mechanisms."

Purpose: This first meeting aimed to focus on the DXD token-related matters, separate from broader governance issues within DXdao.\n\n2. New Token Model Recap: The new token model approved in December has four key elements: DXD price floor guarantee, inverse bonds, new DXD minting in exchange for NAV assets, and protocol-owned liquidity for DXD.\n\n3. Price Floor Guarantee Implementation: DXdao has been fulfilling its price floor guarantee largely through member redemption balancers, with several in the proposal queue. A new redemptor contract is a topic of discussion but not yet implemented.\n\n4. Current Redemption Stats: Approximately $5.6 million in redemptions has been requested, reducing circulating supply and effectively distributing a premium to remaining DXD holders.\n\n5. Inverse Bonds and New Minting: These two elements have not been implemented, and discussions suggest they require complex development and careful consideration.\n\n6. Protocol-Owned Liquidity: DXdao has begun providing its own assets for liquidity on Swapr, meeting commitments partially.\n\n7. Market Signals: The committee discussed the importance of creating market signals, such as through inverse bonds or adjusting the treasury allocation for tokens like SWPR.\n\n8. Treasury Management: Concerns were raised about the increasing proportions of \"other\" tokens in the treasury due to stablecoins and ETH being used for redemptions, possibly warranting a rebalancing.\n\n9. 6% Commitment: DXdao's goal to spend at least 6% of the treasury to fund product and operations over the next six months was reasserted, which could be adjusted according to the treasury size and market environment.\n\n10. Further Discussion: Open questions remain regarding how to optimize the current redemption mechanism to make it trustless for both DXdao and token holders, considering aspects like the redemptor contract and member balancers.\n\nOverall, the meeting focused on monitoring the DXD market, the implementation of the new token model, and discussing ways to improve current mechanisms and align long-term incentives while navigating the transition period following these significant shifts in monetary policy."

Long-Term Vision for DXD: The speaker envisions DXD as an on-chain financial vehicle that represents the value of various investments and products created by DXdao. DXD's value should rise with the treasury assets, not through \"tokenomics shell games.\"\n\n2. Proposed Monetary Policy Framework: The speaker discussed the need for a framework that includes tools like a floor price guarantee, inverse bonds, and new DXD minting mechanisms to ensure liquidity and stability in DXD's market value.\n\n3. Redemption and Liquidity: There was acknowledgment of the need for a system that allows DXD holders to redeem tokens without creating heavy overheads for DXdao. Ideally, a market-driven redemption process rather than one directly managed by DXdao is preferred.\n\n4. Product Development and Innovation: The speaker emphasized the importance of continuing to fund product development to support DXdao's mission, suggesting allocating a percentage of the treasury's growth for ongoing and future projects.\n\n5. Creation of a Monetary Policy Committee: The installment of a formal structure involving DXD holders to manage the proposed monetary policy, communicate changes transparently, and ensure the sustainability of fiscal strategies was discussed.\n\n6. Concerns about Buybacks and Exit Liquidity: The speaker from 1kx, Robert, provided a Devil's Advocate perspective, discussing the potential downsides of focusing heavily on buybacks and exit liquidity. He argued that the emphasis should be on building value within DXdao rather than finding ways for investors to exit.\n\n7. Process and Timeline: There was some debate about the timeline for adopting new policies, with one member pushing for quicker action, while others advocated for allowing more time for community discussion and feedback.\n\n8. Overall Goals: The overarching goal communicated was to focus less on the mechanisms around DXD redemption and more on building decentralized products and a robust ecosystem, which will ultimately drive the value of DXD and the treasury."

    "summary": "Key Points from the Meeting Transcript:\n\n1. The discussion revolved around various proposals on both the mainnet and gnosis chain for DXdao, including:\n   - Payment for disclosing a vulnerability in the contributor reward scheme.\n   - Implementation of a new contributor reward scheme to prevent similar vulnerabilities.\n   - Several contributor proposals and payments.\n   - Consideration of a DXD token working group meeting.\n\n2. The DXdao vulnerability involved a multiplier in the contributor scheme that was not reflected in the UI, allowing for potential exploitation to claim excessive rewards. The issue has been rectified with UI warnings and proposals to redeploy the scheme to ensure only a single period can be claimed.\n\n3. There was debate on the appropriate bounty to reward the disclosure of the vulnerability, with proposals put forward for 150k and 200k USDC.\n\n4. Concerns were raised about the potential for an entity to stall DXdao governance using the gen token, which is less valuable and less liquid. This highlights weaknesses in holographic consensus with a weak token and suggests a need to consider a stronger token, such as DXD, in the future.\n\n5. Discussions on the phase two restructuring were based on a forum post and included polls about implementing a six-month budgetary cycle for squads, exploring Squad Accountability or Advisory Councils, and solidifying a vision for DXdao that speaks to enabling community freedom.\n\n6. Concerns about Squad Accountability Councils included how to define their role and function, ensuring clarity in what value the vision delivers, and the need to evolve towards the purpose of enabling community freedom within communities.\n\n7. For effective feedback and improvement, internal use of DXdao's governance platform, Davi, is encouraged among contributors before it can be introduced to external communities.\n\n8. There might be an upcoming DXdao community call and the release of a report from the retreat containing assessments, feedback, and recommendations for the organization.\n\n9. The meeting closed with encouragement for attendees to become more active in using Davi and sharing feedback to guide its development.\n\n(Note: Due to the nature of machine-generated transcripts, the content may contain inaccuracies and incomplete information.

    "summary": "Key Points of the DXdao Meeting Transcript:\n\n1. Proposal Roundup: There are no current proposals on the mainnet, but there are three proposals waiting for execution. High gas prices on the Ethereum mainnet have been limiting activity. Several proposals on the xDai chain (now called Gnosis Chain) were discussed, including a buyback order, worker proposals, a grant proposal for Atlantis World, and contributor proposals.\n\n2. Quick Wallet Scheme Issue: There was a permission issue with the Quick Wallet Scheme that did not allow executions. The solution involved redeploying and re-registering the schemes with the correct permissions. This was a minor technical error that required a governance operation to fix.\n\n3. Hats Finance Collaboration: DXdao considered depositing 790 DXD (about $500k) into the Hats Finance bug bounty program to incentivize white-hat hackers and earn \"protocol protection mining\" rewards. The deposited funds would also support the Hats Finance ecosystem, which DXdao has invested in.\n\n4. Buyback Program Update: DXdao has acquired over 17% of the circulating supply of DXD through its buyback program. There was a decline in trade volume and discussions about DXD liquidity, including how circulating supply is defined since CoinGecko's information might be outdated. A conversation about consolidating DXD liquidity across different networks is needed.\n\n5. DAO Denver Partnership: DXdao is considering a partnership with DAO Denver, possibly involving financial sponsorship. They received feedback that their original proposal's requested sponsorship amount was too high for a two-day event. There's a free partnership proposal and discussions about an appropriate sponsorship level are ongoing.\n\n6. Discord REP Rewards: DXdao is preparing to distribute REP rewards to active Q4 Discord community members. This may impact governance processes due to the number of transactions required for distribution.\n\n7. Contributor Stipend for ETHDenver: DXdao drafted a proposal for a contributor stipend to cover the cost of transportation, accommodation, and COVID-19 testing for ETHDenver. Contributors will submit actual expenses for reimbursement within specified limits.\n\n8. Contributor Review Process: DXdao completed its first contributor review process, where core contributors reviewed each other's performance. The goal is to provide valuable feedback and iterate on the review process for future improvements."

The meeting covered the second instance of ESP (Ethereum Signal Protocol) and DxD (DXdao's transferable token) inclusion in voting power calculations.\n2. There has been an update to the ESP instance which now factors in DxD Holdings alongside REP (reputation, soulbound tokens). Holding more than 10 DxD equates to one voting point.\n3. Discussion on the complexity of the current priorities voting system, with too many priorities leading to information overload, and a need to simplify the signaling process.\n4. Suggestion to narrow down the number of priorities, perhaps to no more than five for DXdao and three for each guild, and have them driven by the guilds instead of being presented by DXdao to capture new ideas or sidelined old ideas.\n5. Proposal to make voting more community-oriented, by providing a simpler and quicker voting process, akin to a \"Tinder of governance,\" allowing for easier engagement from community members.\n6. Mention of the challenges of involving the broader community in governance, especially those not deeply involved with DXdao.\n7. Discussion on using Snapshot for swapper token holders to engage the community and direct the priorities for Swapper, as swapper token holders need more control and say in the direction of their token's usage.\n8. Emphasis on the need to iterate and experiment with different methods of voting and engaging the community, while possibly maintaining the ESP for continuity and comparing changes over time.\n9. Agreement on the importance of expanding the governance base and involving different stakeholders and communities who bring new perspectives to the circumstances of DXdao and its guilds.\n10.

The call agenda included a proposal roundup to review various proposals, a discussion on upcoming daylight savings time changes, recommendations from the Operations Guild for the treasury management position, and a potential M stable acquisition proposal.\n\n2. The daylight savings time change will not affect the UTC time of the calls, but North American participants will experience a change in local time for two weeks until Europe also changes time, after which the UTC time will shift to 1500.\n\n3. The Operations Guild has prepared a recommendation proposal for the treasury management position, proposing to onboard an individual contributor, Maddie G, who has prior experience and would be cost-effective. This recommendation also suggests further exploring long-term treasury management solutions such as utilizing investment managers like Kaparki or Avant-garde in the future.\n\n4. DXdao is considering acquiring M stable, which is currently seeking an acquisition due to its dwindling Runway and unsustainable financial model. The discussion included M stable's assets, treasury amount, TVL, and potential acquisition structures. The timeline for this process is very quick, requiring a preliminary proposal by the end of the week and final proposals by the end of the next week. However, concerns were raised about the viability of this acquisition for DXdao, and alternative acquirers were suggested as potentially better fits.\n\n5. There was a forum discussion about swapper token next steps, creating collaboration within the community on developing this aspect further.\n\n6. Another discussion was about increasing written assessments and accountability within DXdao, with a call for nominations or applications for individuals interested in becoming mission wardens.\n\n7.

    "summary": "The meeting focused on discussing \"governance 2.0\" which seems to be the next evolution of decentralized governance systems. The key points from the meeting are:\n\n1. Concerns over Token Voting: The speaker raised issues with token-based voting systems, noting that they can lead to voter apathy, over-representation of capital interests, and conflicts of interest where large token holders may vote for their own interests rather than the DAO's.\n\n2. Examples of Faulty Token Voting: Real-world examples were provided, including the BarnBridge versus Saffron Finance vote on Aave and an issue with Nexus Mutual, to demonstrate times when token voting did not represent community interests.\n\n3. Reputation-Based Voting: The speaker advocated for a system that combines token voting with reputation-based voting, where reputation is non-transferable and can be earned through meaningful contributions to the DAO.\n\n4. Upgrading Governance: A proposal was put forth for DAOs to transition from purely token-based governance to a hybrid system. The transition would involve locking tokens to generate reputation over time, with a mechanism that gradually reduces the proportion of reputation distributed.\n\n5. Holographic Consensus: The speaker briefly touched on this governance mechanism developed by DAOstack, which DXdao is advancing. It requires staking on proposals, where the stake is lost if the proposal fails but returned with a bonus if it passes.\n\n6. Implementation Challenges: There was a discussion on the difficulties of implementing complex governance systems and the need for frameworks that allow for no-code deployment.\n\n7. Decentralization for New and Existing Organizations: It was mentioned that truly starting a decentralized DAO from day one might be nearly impossible. For organizations looking to decentralize, initial centralized mechanisms like snapshots might be fine, but with a plan to decentralize governance in mind.\n\nIn summary, the speaker encouraged thinking beyond simple token voting and towards more equitable governance mechanisms that recognize the contributions and participation of the community at large. The discussion also touched on technical and practical considerations of evolving governance systems."

    "summary": "Key Points from the Meeting:\n\n1. Anna from Gnosis presented an incentive program connected to trading volume generated on the Gnosis protocol through their Mesa platform and other channels. DXdao has the potential to earn 5k GNO rewards if certain trading volumes are reached by December 31st. The reward payout is proportional to the volume generated, with higher milestones leading to higher proportional payouts.\n\n2. DXdao can increase volume on the Gnosis protocol by advising IDEO projects to set up liquidity on Gnosis's Conditional Market Makers (CMM) for a fixed period post-IDEO and by potentially using GNO rewards to set up CMM strategies themselves. There's also a chance to manage the treasury through Gnosis protocol more efficiently.\n\n3. Discussions on deploying Gnosis protocol to xDai chain explored potential use cases, although any deployment is likely to be more of a test environment than one for high-volume transactions.\n\n4. DXdao's treasury management strategies were discussed, including the possibility of integrating GNO into treasury strategies and the benefits of doing so. There's an interest in potentially distributing GNO payouts based on milestones rather than waiting until year-end.\n\n5. There's an upcoming marketing initiative for DXdao, including an advertisement on the DeepDAO website. Still, it's debated whether the ad should focus more on recruitment or branding. The DAO is also considering evaluating the \"health score\" of DXdao.\n\n6. Discussions about potential partnerships and advisory roles were held, particularly regarding a partnership with Luna, a social platform for traders. The partnership could involve cross-promotion, content creation, integrating DXdao products into Luna's platform, and advising on governance.

The concept of \"month in review\" summaries was well received, indicating a desire for more frequent and comprehensive updates.\n\n5. The discussion transitions into a debate about whether the DAO should provide liquidity in DX Swap from its treasury, which would mean selling DXD at market price rather than through the bonding curve. This raises concerns about transparency and potentially breaking the \"social contract\" with investors who bought into the higher bonding curve price.\n\n6. Several ideas are proposed, including conducting a buyback of DXD at its current price as an investment by the DAO, which could be beneficial if the price increases in the future. However, this could set a precedent that the DAO would only use its DXD at or above the bonding curve price, effectively limiting its ability to use those funds.\n\n7. It's acknowledged that focusing on DXD price is important for keeping investors happy, despite a long-term strategy focused on technology and building revenue-generating products.\n\n8. The group agrees that productive criticism and feedback are crucial for governance and should be encouraged, differentiating between constructive criticism and unhelpful negativity.\n\n9. Plans are discussed to address a serious bug found on the xDai deployment related to updating plugin manager parameters, which would require migrating DXdao to a new DAO clone to fix permissions issues. This migration might also present an opportunity to include more members with mapped reputations.\n\n10. The meeting concludes with technical discussions about funding transfers on the xDai bridge and the use of a new DAO clone.\n\nIn summary, the meeting covered strategic and operational challenges, focusing primarily on the DAO's swap strategy, issues with transparency and communication, handling DXD liquidity, and the urgent need to address technical problems with the xDai deployment."

    "summary": "The meeting involved a discussion between members of DXdao and Galen Wolfe-Pauly from Urbit. Here are the key points from the meeting:\n\n1. **Introduction**: Galen joined the call to engage with DXdao members for an open-ended conversation about Urbit, answer questions, and lay down the basics for the benefit of newcomers. A deck was prepared to introduce Urbit adequately.\n\n2. **Urbit Overview**: Urbit is a combination of a decentralized ID system (Urbit ID) and a peer-to-peer overlay operating system (Urbit OS). The goal is to provide a simple, durable, and personal computing platform that offers high trust communication and potentially transactions. The key principles of Urbit are simplicity, durability, and personal ownership.\n\n3. **Urbit ID and OS**:\n   - Urbit ID is a decentralized identity system that lives on the Ethereum mainnet.\n   - Urbit OS is a compact virtual machine that runs an encrypted network and acts as a personal event-sourced database.\n\n4. **Demonstration**: Galen gave a brief demo of 'Landscape', which is the primary client for Urbit, showing chat, links to resources, notebooks for collaborative work, etc.\n\n5. **Relation to DXdao**: Urban's design philosophy of reflecting the patterns and practices of a community in the software used seems to align well with DXdao's ethos. As DXdao is actively seeking task management and collaborative tools, Urbit could be a potential solution.\n\n6. **Hosting Pilot Program**: Urbit is working on a hosting platform to remove the pain of self-hosting and maintaining nodes, which might become available to DXdao members in about six weeks to two months.\n\n7. **Funding for Development**: Urbit has a grants program and is open to funding development projects that would be beneficial for both Urbit and DXdao. DXdao’s specific use case of community governance and voting on proposals could be an interesting application to be built within the Urbit ecosystem.\n\n8. **Proposal for Collaboration**: Both sides expressed interest in formalizing a proposal to explore how a signaling/voting tool could be created on Urbit for DXdao's use. This tool could potentially help in making the governance process more efficient by allowing signal voting within the secure Urbit environment before committing transactions to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n9. **Phased Integration**: It was suggested that DXdao might start using Urbit by integrating it internally within smaller groups (like the dev team) before considering a larger rollout.\n\n10. **Potential for Broader Impact**: Any tools developed by DXdao within Urbit could also be useful to other decentralized communities that face similar challenges of governance and collaboration."

Swapper Farming Launch: The call marked the start of a new farming program for Swapper, with a countdown watched live by participants. There was a lot of excitement over the Swapper protocol surpassing 10 million Total Value Locked (TVL) even before farming officially started.\n\n2. Swapper Overview: Zett, a member of the Swapper team, provided background on Swapper, noting that it was a decentralized product, controlled by the DXdao, with no centralized ownership. He emphasized the unique features such as do-it-yourself farming, dual rewards, and governance via the Swapper token, highlighting the decentralization efforts like hosting on ethereum.limo.\n\n3. Swapper Guild and Governance: The future of Swapper will involve the Swapper Guild, a governance mechanism that will allow Swapper token holders to vote on various aspects of the protocol. The guild will initially start as a signaling tool, where token holders can give input on decisions, which DXdao REP holders will then respect and execute.\n\n4. Future Developments: Zett also mentioned future plans for a Swapper bridge to facilitate transactions across chains and integrate with other services effectively. They plan to develop an \"App Store\" within Swapper that will allow other services to be integrated through widgets, improving user experience.\n\n5. Farming 2.0: The team discussed creating a more sophisticated farming mechanism that aligns incentives better than traditional farming, tentatively known as \"farming 2.0.\" This system would conditionally reward farmers based on meeting specific goals or KPIs for the project.\n\n6. Swapper Tokens and Epochs: The team clarified that the farming campaigns are temporary and require manual opt-in for each epoch, which is currently set at 14 days. They are looking into ways to consolidate campaigns for ease of management, potentially extending campaign lengths.\n\n7. Claiming Rewards: There were questions on how to claim and track rewards. The team promised improvements in the rewards interface for a better user experience.\n\n8. POAP Distribution: There was a limited-time POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) airdrop for call participants that could be claimed by messaging a Discord bot. The code was shared during the meeting.\n\n9. Community Engagement: The call included open discussions and engagement with the community, with various contributors participating and interacting on the new launch.\n\n10.

    "summary": "Here is a summary of the key points from the Geek Styles Priorities Board Monthly Check-in for February 2023:\n\n1. Purpose of the Priorities Board: The board was created to gather more feedback from the DXdao governance to gain better transparency on the community's priorities.\n\n2. Initial Learnings: This is the second month into the process, and the aim is to gather initial reactions and discuss the results from the initial round of priority setting using the Extensible Signaling Primitive (ESP) app.\n\n3. Participation and Results: There were at least 15 addresses that participated in the priority setting, which were mainly active current contributors. The priorities for DXdao and the various guilds like Operations, Voice, Swapr, DXgov, and Carrot were discussed.\n\n4. Discussion on ESP: The ESP app is potentially a useful tool for capturing ongoing signals from rep holders. It may need improvements like more detailed priority descriptions and ways to avoid overlapping priorities which can dilute votes.\n\n5. DXT Holder Engagement: There is a focus on figuring out how to increase participation from DXT holders and rep holders who may not be very active in DXdao governance. There was a debate about whether to make it easier for DXT holders to vote without filling out a form to encourage more engagement.\n\n6. Importance of Signal Gathering: A key aspect discussed was the importance of gathering signals from the governance community before making proposals, rather than taking the initial signals as definitive decisions.\n\n7. Functional Improvements: Responding to signals might require different mechanisms like weighted voting or ongoing votes. The ability to allocate different amounts of votes to different priorities was also seen as an important feature for future development of the ESP app.\n\n8. Challenges with Current Tools: There is still a need to simplify the voting process, provide more detailed explanations for the signals, and potentially integrate discussions directly into the ESP tool or a similar platform.\n\n9. Closing Thoughts: Ultimately, this process is designed to better understand what the broader community sees as priorities, promote deeper discussion about the direction of DXdao, and improve decision-making through enhanced governance tools."

There are also separate Swapper relayer audit proposals and a Gnosis protocol relayer audit payment proposal under consideration.\n\n2. **Audit Proposals:** The topic shifts to the importance of having a reliable and affordable auditor (Phil) who provides high-quality work, albeit with a current backlog. There's a need to do a better job surfacing prior audits and upcoming audit schedules. The value of having a long-term relationship with an experienced auditor is stressed.\n\n3. **Swapper Updates and Proposals:** John joined the meeting to discuss updates about Swapper, which is DXdao’s own project requiring smart contract governance. They encountered an unexpected issue with a proposal related to deploying Swapper; the deployer contract didn't function as intended due to gas restrictions. Despite this hiccup, the timeline for Swapper won't be significantly affected. This highlighted the importance of authorizing smart contracts before their deployment.\n\n4. **Paul McInerney's Worker Proposal:** There was a spotlight on Paul McInerney’s proposal, which includes governance research, focusing on voting trends, prioritization of proposals, off-chain signaling, internal communication, and possibly constructing a research paper for external publication. The proposal represents a part-time commitment due to other business responsibilities.\n\n5. **Onboarding Process:** Keenan raised several points about the onboarding process for DXdao, including challenges in understanding next steps, identifying DXdao's current needs, improving internal communication, ambiguity in worker proposals, and navigating DXD compensation contracts. He proposed solutions like creating a worker information dashboard and clarifying documentation.\n\n6. **1.x Proposals and Xdai DXdao:** Skye reported on the current progress of proposals on the xDai chain, including a community competition for Omen markets featuring an xDai reward. The competition had initially been set up with incorrect timing but was being renegotiated. The conversation touched upon the difficulties in generating interest and participation in xDai DXdao and the importance of not segregating governance across too many different platforms.\n\n7. **Private Versus Public Discussions:** The meeting discussed the nature of private versus public negotiations and information sharing, especially in potential partnerships like that with Gnosis. There was a consensus towards preferring radical transparency while also acknowledging the potential need for private negotiations with full accountability to rep holders.\n\n8. **Governance Dashboard:** There were suggestions to create a more centralized and comprehensive governance dashboard that integrates both mainnet and xDai governance activities to avoid fragmentation and confusion. Collaboration with Gnosis on governance interfaces was suggested as a future step. \n\nThe transcript provides insights into DXdao's current initiatives, internal processes, and the challenges encountered while they strive to maintain transparency and decentralized governance."

    "summary": "Key points from the meeting transcript:\n\n1. The DXdao product strategy meeting started with a review of the content calendar product priorities to set the stage.\n2. Immediate updates were sought for Mesa and Omen, with work having progressed separately on those projects.\n3. The main discussion was intended to focus on Swapr across several areas.\n4. The product priorities list included a proposal for liquidity from DXdao for Swapr, Swapr liquidity on mainnet and xDai, DXD farming campaigns, IL (impermanent loss) insurance, DXD buyback transparency announcement, Omen token announcement, prospective SWAPR v1 improvements, and potential launches for Mesa and arbitrary Swapr features.\n5. Mesa's discussion deferred to Martin, who had some innovative ideas regarding auction mechanisms to balance investors’ interests and maximize funds raised for clients. He proposed a system allowing the price to move up and down, enabling continuous buying even after demand meets supply.\n6. For Omen, there was a shift in priorities to focus on the token launch's success over other functionalities, prioritizing liquidity mining contracts for Omen markets and ensuring these functions are ready for the Omen token launch.\n7. Swapr developments included a new release with a network switcher, which allows users to switch networks without a connected wallet, and an option to add networks easily to MetaMask, along with progress on farming features.\n8. The conversation about liquidity centered on the importance of the WETH (wrapped ether) xDai pair and potential to add more liquidity to compete with other DEXes on xDai, such as HoneySwap and Baoswap.\n9. The team discussed experimenting with different fee structures for liquidity pools and possibly being the first to create a gold pair on xDai using Synthetix's gold token.\n10. The possibility of implementing IL insurance or conditional token farming as an innovative feature was also discussed, with the technical feasibility of wrapping and redeeming conditional tokens explored.\n11. The meeting closed with the announcement of a happy hour for team members as a casual, stress-free activity.\n\nThe meeting focused on strategic discussions about product development, feature implementations, liquidity management, and innovative mechanisms for auctions and liquidity mining, along with community engagement efforts."

    "summary": "The key points from the meeting transcript can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Discussion revolved around the DXdao final restructuring proposal, which had a vote with 34 for and 13 against.\n2. Arguments were made regarding the fairness and equitability of the dissolution and distribution of funds, whereby some participants believed that the three main DXdao products (Swapr, Carrot, DXgov) should be treated equally in the distribution.\n3. There was contention regarding some participants not fully understanding the implications of the 70% NAV Redemption model for DxD holders and the potentially spiraling effects it could cause to the DXdao treasury.\n4. The current monetary policy and redemption process were deemed by some as not well-communicated to the contributors and community members.\n5. Concerns were raised about the future of the treasury, the budget, and how large redemptions could result in significant budget cuts for the coming cycles.\n6. The broader implication of the proposal seemed to encompass a significant shift in the direction of the DXdao, potentially making existing structures and discussions moot.\n7. There was also a suggestion to explore alternative funding methods to potentially provide financial relief to both sides: those wanting to exit and those wanting to continue building products.\n8. Finally, it was indicated that if the restructuring proposal passes, it might eliminate the need for further discussions in meetings like the one that was taking place.\n\nIt is clear from the transcript that there was considerable disagreement and debate about both the implications of the current monetary policy and the fairness of the restructuring proposal among members of the DXdao community."

    "summary": "Key points from the September 30, 2021 DXdao community call:\n\n1. Swapper Farming Epoch 2 Launch: The second epoch of Swapper farming was set to launch during the call, with updates to better the farming experience on mobile and minor fixes. Swapper Beta v6 had added echo routing on Arbitrum and updated the token list with UCT as a common base token. Future plans include adding more markets and integrating bridges with Swapper, starting with the Arbifym bridge.\n\n2. DXgov Updates: The DXgov team now consists of about five developers focusing on governance. They are working on polishing the DXvote UI to simplify it for non-technical users and enabling on-chain treasury management initiatives. DXvote is currently in beta on Arbitrum and Xdai. A bigger focus is on recruitment to expand development capacity.\n\n3. Buyback Program Update: The DXdao buyback program had its third round of proposals, with a goal of using funds to repurchase DXD tokens from the market. They had repurchased over 5000 DXD using Ethereum and are looking to solve technical challenges with Gnosis Protocol v1, which is being phased out.\n\n4. Adamant Finance Integration: The Adamant Finance team introduced their Swapper integration, an auto-compounding platform that takes Swapper farm rewards and automatically compounds them for users. Adamant plans to follow Swapper's one-year liquidity mining campaign, helping add value and TVL to the Swapper ecosystem.\n\n5. Community Involvement: Community members are encouraged to share opinions on farming changes in Discord or on the forum. There are planned reductions in USDC/USDT pool allocations as Swapper shifts focus from initial incentives to longer-term strategies.\n\n6. Swapper Token Distribution: The community call discussed how Swapper's liquidity mining incentives are designed not just to reward users but also to distribute voting rights and ownership of Swapper responsibly.\n\n7. Ongoing Projects: The call touched on ongoing projects like Omen and Aqua, suggesting that while the current focus is on Swapper and DXgov, other projects have not been forgotten and are expected to continue in development.\n\nIn summary, the DXdao community call covered the launch of Swapper's second farming epoch, updates to DXgov and the Swapper platform, the ongoing DxD buyback initiative, and the new integration with Adamant Finance. The call underscored the importance of community feedback and involvement in shaping future updates and developments."

    "summary": "Key points from the DXdao token working group call:\n\n1. The group discussed various token models in comparison with DXdao's current model, Continuous Organization, emphasizing the need to understand the sources of value for a token and solution requirements.\n\n2. There was agreement that DXdao's current bonding curve model, which segregated treasuries for product development and price support, proved inefficient and ineffective in driving value to the DXD token.\n\n3. The group examined alternative models such as Yearn Finance's Wi-Fi token, which involved a buyback program to reduce token supply and attempted to drive value via product fees.\n\n4. They discussed Temple DAO and Olympus DAO, which are yield farming protocols with treasury-controlled assets, and how their models have influenced token value through direct rewards to stakers and management of yield farming strategies.\n\n5. A significant part of the discussion focused on the perceived market value of DXdao's token, DXD, and options to improve its liquidity and market confidence, which affects both new investors' interest and existing token holders' sentiment.\n\n6. Ideas for short-term improvements included executing larger market or limit orders for DXD using Cowswap, possibly adopting a liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP) from Temple DAO, or implementing Gnosis Auction for managed sell-off.\n\n7. For the long-term approach, the group considered aligning DXD's token model towards greater treasury efficiency and exploring mechanisms that give token holders fair opportunities to enter or exit the community at a market value reflecting the treasury's growth.\n\n8. The group noted the importance of improving the perception of DXD in the market, suggesting that a coordinated effort comprising short-term liquidity improvements could coincide with unveiling a new token model to reintroduce DXdao to the market successfully."

The team is placing an emphasis on finding a strong candidate for HR/people mover and marketing narrative builder, considering these roles crucial for driving DXdao's narrative and direction. \n\n3. Furthermore, there's a need for treasury management and accounting to keep track of transactions and investments across various projects, as a significant sum (158,000 DAI) was recently authorized for worker payments.\n\n4. The concept of a general counsel role was proposed, aiming to provide legal guidance and assistance internally, both for individual contributors (e.g., setting up an LLC) and for the DAO's overall strategies and operations.\n\n5. There was mention of introducing ETH and possibly USDC liquidity on xDai for Swapper, indicating a potential expansion of financial operations to xDai alongside Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n6. DXdao is considering providing liquidity to its product Swapper on xDai and possibly on Arbitrum in the future, with the goal of establishing a strong presence on these platforms.\n\n7. Opolis was discussed as a cooperative employment organization that provides traditional employment benefits to contributors of DAOs, and there's an interest in engaging with them further.\n\n8. It was noted that there's possible interest from MakerDAO in setting up an MKR/xDai pool on HoneySwap, indicating growing cross-protocol collaboration on xDai.\n\n9. Towards the end of the meeting, there was a passing of responsibility for the meeting coordination to Sky, as John will be focusing more on product development and less on handling this call.\n\n10.

An app demo was presented for a tool that allows translating on-chain token balances or REP into weighted votes for ranked-choice voting. This app is in development and could be used for future monthly voting processes.\n\n3. There was a consensus that governance 2.0 is a top priority for DXdao, including steps towards its implementation and a focus on developing a flagship product vision and mission.\n\n4. The priorities board is non-directive but serves as a signal from DXdao governance to indicate collective priorities toward product development and organizational goals.\n\n5. Different guilds within DXdao, such as operations, voice, and product guilds (e.g., swapper, carrot, DXgov), have their own specific priorities that align with DXdao's overall direction.\n\n6. The intentions are for this process to help guide budget allocation decisions in the future, align stakeholder interests, and showcase governance tools that could be used by other communities.\n\n7. The next steps involve summarizing the meeting, discussing on forums, opening for new submissions, and setting up the voting process (potentially using the new app for polling) for the next month's priority board update."

Two main proposals are live on the mainnet:\n   - Offloading RAI from the treasury (second round).\n   - Funding governance gas contracts.\n\n2. The RAI proposal is in response to a significant negative redemption rate of -25%, meaning holding RAI could devalue it by 25% over a year. The DAO has decided to sell some RAI for other stablecoins.\n\n3. There's a proposal for an audit of Carrot v1 by Team Omega for 35,000 USDC, which is nearing completion.\n\n4. Discussion occurred about transferring funds to Gnosis Chain from the main Ethereum network. It was proposed to possibly transfer $1 million worth of USDT to cover four months of operational expenses.\n\n5. Concerns were raised about the solvency of Tether (USDT) and the suggestion was made to offload all USDT in favor of more reliable stablecoins like USDC.\n\n6. The appreciation DAO using Coordinate for Epoch 2 is requesting feedback and approval for the use of 30,000 as a fund for the next epoch. Clarification was sought on whether contributors prefer the distribution in WXDAI or DXD.\n\n7. Governance participation by voting on-chain was encouraged to maintain decentralization and the health of the DAO’s operations.\n\n8. Issues with Alchemy not recognizing the DAO's USDC balance were discussed, suggesting a potential move away from Alchemy or re-hosting it.\n\n9. The DXdao \"Month in Review\" was posted during the meeting, representing the collective’s activities. \n\nIn summary, the DXdao discussed proposals to manage their RAI holdings due to negative redemption rates, transferring USDT to Gnosis Chain for operational expenses, auditing Carrot v1, the appreciation DAO framework and Epoch 2 funding, as well as technical issues with Alchemy and tooling for DAO governance and voting."

    "summary": "The November 3rd DXdao meeting focused on the DXD token working group and covered several key points:\n\n1. **DXD Buybacks and Treasury**: The buyback mechanism has transitioned from GP v1 to CowSwap, leading to fewer buybacks with smaller transactions due to a change from limit orders to market buys. The DXD token has been purchased with Ether, the balance of which has now surpassed the buyback reserve, and the DAO has started tapping into additional authorized funds.\n\n2. **Token Value**: The DXdao wants to establish a simple, clear understanding of DXD value. Ideas presented include considering DXD as a representation of the DAO's treasury value or as a token with governance rights over dividend streams coming from DXdao.\n\n3. **Funding for Products**: There was a discussion about how DXdao could continue to fund operations and product development in the context of the new token model. One suggestion was committing a yearly percentage (5-7%) of the treasury assets to this cause, adjustable by governance.\n\n4. **Governance Structure Changes**: The working group discussed the steps needed to transition to the new DXD token model, with the introduction of governance processes to handle price support levels, the creation of inverse DXD bonds, new DXD minting, and maintaining a liquid market for DXD.\n\n5. **Monetary Policy Committee**: The formation of a DXD Monetary Policy Committee was proposed to manage various aspects of the token model, such as providing quarterly updates, managing liquidity, and issuing recommendations for bond issuance.\n\n6. **Implementation Timeline**: A draft text of a signal proposal is aimed to be put forth before the next working group meeting, with suggestions to be gathered from the community. The goal is to pass the proposal by mid-December. Elements like price floor support and liquid market facilitation could be implemented relatively easily, while inverse bonds and minting new DXD will require more effort.\n\n7. **Public Discussion**: There was a lively discussion about the concept of public goods funding with opinions shared on how DXdao should allocate funding to projects and whether it should invest in public goods. The group considered whether focusing too much on preserving capital might deter from the DAO's mission to build a decentralized world and deliver value.\n\nThe above points highlight the key discussion areas from the November 3rd meeting as DXdao continues to evolve its governance and token utility structure."

Concerns about Worker Compensation:\n   - It was mentioned that 40% of worker compensation is given in DXD, which is vested over time and priced at the bonding curve rate.\n   - There is concern about cell pressure on DXD and workers selling tokens to pay for immediate expenses like rent.\n   - The importance of aligning worker compensation with the long-term value of DXD was emphasized.\n\n2. Debate about Bonding Curve Proposal:\n   - Some members expressed concerns that the proposal to pause the bonding curve was not well-constructed and lacks critical technical details.\n   - There is a debate over whether requiring highly technical proposals may exclude less technically-oriented members from participating in governance.\n\n3. Discussion about DXdao's Intent with the Bonding Curve:\n   - The historical intent of DXdao's bonding curve was to raise funds and enable dividend distribution, as well as buying and selling of the token.\n   - There is a question of whether the current setup aligns with DXdao's initial goals or if it was a convenient choice at the time due to an audited solution by Fairmint.\n\n4. Silencing Concerns:\n   - One member expressed feeling silenced due to an \"elite mentality\" within the DAO that requires expertise to contribute opinions. The importance of ensuring all voices can be heard is underscored.\n\n5. Different Views on Governance and Proposals:\n   - There is a split opinion on whether proposals should contain detailed technical solutions or if they can be more like signposts for further discussion and research.\n   - Some believe that signal proposals should convey a clear action plan, while others feel that there should be room for iteration and improvement upon initial ideas.\n\n6. Future of the Bonding Curve:\n   - The discussion included talk about potential structural changes to the curve, with some advocating for it to remain as is, while others suggest pausing or amending it. \n   - The need for a more informed and technically precise proposal was agreed upon, one that takes into account the feedback and consensus of the DAO's members.\n\n7. Importance of DXD Holder Voices:\n   - The sentiment that DXD holders need a more substantial voice in governance decisions was strong, and the challenge of balancing the input of rep holders (representatives) with DXD holders was evident.\n\n8. Consensus and Voting:\n   - Finding consensus for making changes within the DAO is challenging and requires considerable effort to align different perspectives.\n   - The importance of having well-constructed proposals that can facilitate consensus-building was stressed.\n\n9. Outcome and Next Steps:\n   - Regardless of whether the current proposal passes or fails, there is recognition that more work is needed to address the bonding curve issue.\n   - Future proposals are expected to include more detail, and there is an intent to measure the sentiment of DXD holders more accurately.\n\nThe meeting reflects the ongoing challenges of governance within DXdao and the struggle to align short-term actions with long-term goals."

Orbis Mainnet Launch: Baptiste announced that Orbis plans to launch on mainnet around July 2022, opening up their SDK to developers to create content on Orbis. The launch will entail a migration from the Ceramic testnet to mainnet and introduce new user experiences.\n\n3. Ceramic and IPFS: Orbis is built upon Ceramic which, in turn, relies on IPFS for storing data. Discussion touched on the decentralized nature of IPFS, where data persistence depends on nodes opting to host content, and how Ceramic adds structure and accessibility on top of IPFS’s raw capabilities.\n\n4. Governance and Economics: The Orbis team is considering a governance model that could potentially involve managing schemas and decentralized content moderation. The value capture for Orbis could come from both the protocol and front-end levels, with potential monetization paths discussed, including commissions from in-app NFT transactions.\n\n5. Participation and Initiative: The group emphasized the need for proactive initiative in DAOs rather than mere participation, acknowledging the risk of burnout among members and the importance of structured proposals and onboarding experiences to manage attention and avoid overwhelm.\n\n6. Legal Considerations for DAOs: There's a growing interest in legal structures for DAOs, with questions about whether to form legal entities and how governance should operate.\n\n7. Raising Awareness for DXdao: The group acknowledged that DXdao is ahead in governance thinking and is considering more outreach, via avenues like Twitter spaces and collaborating with other entities to share DXdao's learnings and experiences. This could increase awareness and bring in new contributors.\n\n8. Upcoming Events: Plans for the Paris event with Gnosis Chain and get POAP are underway, involving DXdao contributors. Additionally, there is anticipation for the Hacker House event, with website design and choreography confirmed and efforts to announce it soon.\n\nOverall, the DXdao community discussed strategic collaboration, technological advancements with Orbis, ways to combat DAO challenges, and upcoming ecosystem events."

    "summary": "Key points from the meeting transcript:\n\n1. Discussion on Governance Models: \n   - The group debated the governance model for the Omen platform, which is a product of DXdao.\n   - They consider whether to adopt a liquid token governance model, where governance rights are attached to ERC20 tokens, or to use reputation-based governance similar to the model used by DXdao (non-transferable, reputational voting power).\n\n2. Consequences of Liquid Token Governance:\n   - Concerns were raised that a liquid token governance model may not ensure the same level of operational efficiency and product improvement for Omen as a holographic consensus model.\n   - There were concerns that if the DXdao can override decisions made by token holders, this could create distrust among small holders.\n\n3. Role of DXdao:\n   - DXdao would retain significant influence and control over Omen due to its large token holding.\n   - The group discussed constraining DXdao’s governance influence to prevent it from overwhelming the voices of smaller stakeholders.\n\n4. Revenue Distribution to DXD Holders:\n   - It was recognized that DXD holders should receive the majority of the revenue from Omen, and governance distribution should be balanced to achieve this while still enabling active governance by token holders.\n\n5. Integration with Governance 2.0:\n   - There was a consensus that they are working towards \"Governance 2.0,\" which combines both liquid token governance and reputation-based governance.\n   - The transition to full reputation-based governance would require a period of liquid token governance to build the necessary capabilities and identify active governors.\n\n6. Transition Period and Reputation Distribution:\n   - The group contemplated having an initial period where Omen token holders can govern day-to-day activities, and earn reputation points based on participation.\n   - They considered options for inflating reputation distribution to pave the way for new contributors to gain governance power.\n\n7. Operational Considerations:\n   - The efficiency of Omen's market curation and operation under different governance models was a key concern, with a desire to make Omen competitively superior to other platforms like Augur.\n\n8. DXdao's Brand and Market Positioning:\n   - DXdao branding is strongly associated with reputation-based governance, and any governance model adopted for Omen would need to align with that image.\n   - There was also some discussion about how the chosen governance model would affect the go-to-market strategy for the Omen token.\n\n9. Action Items:\n   - The group agreed on creating a poll to gather opinions on liquid token governance versus reputation-based governance.\n   - They plan to discuss further technical details and carry out a comparative study on using ERC20 guilds versus alchemy for governance.\n\n10. Concerns about Omen as a Product: \n   - There was an emphasis on the importance of making sure Omen as a product is improved and efficiently governed, regardless of the governance model chosen."
